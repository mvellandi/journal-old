Upon being the 2nd commentator to Cam Beck&#8217;s blog, [ChaosScenario](http://www.chaosscenario.com/ "Blog of Cam Beck"), he sent me [Made to Stick](http://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3489114-6396838?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175649022&sr=8-1 "Made to Stick book on Amazon") via Amazon.

I love the packaging and treatment, so I drew it up.

I will definitely go through this book and glean as much insight to share with others. Cam&#8217;s doing this now and has a series of posts relating the book to everyday branding and communication. Check it out if you haven&#8217;t yet.
