I love the plastic perforation on this clamshell packaging from a smoke alarm I bought. So easy to open, and no painful struggle with scissors.

I know such general packaging is made to prevent shrinkage and theft. But when it becomes a major pain in the butt to open, and we&#8217;re left with a negative ongoing impression, it&#8217;s a joy to have such a pleasant package opening experience. Corny but cool.
