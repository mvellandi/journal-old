While biking through un-ventured territory on a mini island in Newport Beach, CA, I came upon this post office whose 3d slab serif typeface stood out against the raised wood. It also has some western-esque features to it on closeup view. A nice little reminder of times long gone by&#8230;and definitely more appealing than the art deco sans, metal lettering at most local post offices.
