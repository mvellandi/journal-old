  - Okay, funky title but after having watched the documentary and some time to reflect, the Secret is a bunch of rehashed old philosophy packaged and marketed to sell a lot of copies

A popular rehashing of some classic psychology applied to daily living. Think positive and attract yourself to what you desire in life. I saw the film and enjoyed it, although the production was a bit over the top. It&#8217;s really just another perspective on maintaining good mental attitudes.

As a student of eastern philosophy and having previously studied NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming), all this is nothing new. The Secret is just packaged in an easy format and marketed/positioned in a way to stand out to people who have never explored personal living psychology and great habit training.

I believe the greatest insight comes when we can just observe our thoughts from a third person perspective. Are they negative, of an assuming nature, overly positive, rational, what? Sssshhhhhhhh&#8230;&#8230;..just observe. If there&#8217;s a bit of anxiety, fear or pain&#8230;acknowledge it&#8217;s there. We can&#8217;t think it away. Embrace it and we can come to terms and resolve it in a reasonable manner. Smile&#8230;take a break. Keep realistic goals and make some deep wishes for life aspirations and dreams. Lastly, on a different angle, watch your diet and bodily health. This is one area of the &#8220;you&#8221; that has a dramatic influence in the subconscious quality of our lives.

Happy Easter everyone!
