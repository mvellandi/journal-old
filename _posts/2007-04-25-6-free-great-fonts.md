Although these MS Vista fonts have been available for some time now, anyone can use them without having to purchase Vista or Office 07. Win users can get them as part of a free PowerPoint Viewer 07 [download](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=048DC840-14E1-467D-8DCA-19D2A8FD7485&displaylang=en "Download Powerpoint Viewer from Microsoft"). Mac users can find an appropriate download from Google [here](http://www.google.com/search?q=vista+fonts+download "Google search for vista fonts download"). The file extension is .ttf, however it&#8217;s an OpenType version allowing cross-compatibility.

So without further adieu, here they are&#8230;set to classic songs to give some zing, because Ipsum Lorem is a bit bland.

Because of their relative &#8216;newness&#8217; they&#8217;re probably best for graphics or PDFs, until they become more widespread installed. In any case, I suggest trying them out because they do add a bit of flair to your docs and even print materials.

What are your favorite typefaces? (Forgot to ask&#8230;.sorry)
