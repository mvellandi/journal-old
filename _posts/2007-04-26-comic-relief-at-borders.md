A few nights ago, my friend Jay and I were reading at Borders Bookstore when the intercom announced (to the best of my memory and imagination):

> _Hello Borders guests,
We&#8217;d like to announce a fun-filled game for all to enjoy. It&#8217;s called: Who isn&#8217;t missing their set of keys? A set of Toyota keys with a metallic blue latch is sitting lonely up here at our service counter and awaiting return to its rightful owner. For all of you playing along who have found their keys resting peacefully, you&#8217;ll be happy to know you have won in a tie for first place._

I felt like I was suddenly on a flight with Southwest. Somewhere in my subconscious, this Borders was now branded a friendly and fun place to be. Not because of a promotional offer nor a warm greeting or goodbye. Memorable indeed.

Have you experienced a similar joy lately? Please do share&#8230;.a little unexpected tickling can be fun to give..(poke poke)
