I first picked up this great story Thursday evening from NPR&#8217;s _All Things Considered_, titled &#8220;<a title="href=">Networks Control of Debates Rankles Pundits</a>&#8220;, by Laura Sydell. Listen to the story &#8211; it&#8217;s an interesting 4 minutes.

On May 3rd, Senators Barack Obama and John Edwards both wrote letters to network execs and party national committee chairs asking for videos to be placed under a creative commons license.

CNN decided on Saturday to be the first to jump in with its <a title="CNN article on democratic presidential candidate debate coverage" href="http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/05/cnn-presidential-debate-footage.html">official announcement</a> that beginning in June, *&#8220;CNN debate coverage will be made available without restrictions at the conclusion of each live debate&#8221;.*

I expect more movement from other camps as well and am interested in which <a title="Wikipedia article on Creative Commons licenses" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses">licensing options</a> will be used. I&#8217;m suspecting networks will take the safest route and use Attribution + Non-Commercial + No Derivatives. If they do that, they&#8217;d at least better break up the video into segments so distributors and their audiences can quickly jump around to topics that interest them, so they could forward video links and discuss topics in a more organized fashion.

For the networks to do it right, they should offer premium content (high bitrate video, transcripts, commentary) on their websites. With the freely licensed content, they should proactively place lower bitrate videos on the various distribution sites with information and links to the premium content.

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

What do **you** think? How can networks effectively create a better product offering with a dual approach? Interactive Marketers, I&#8217;m calling you out&#8230;Recess is now in session.
