Apparently many of my favorite authors&#8217; posts weren&#8217;t coming through in my reader (Grrrrr!! grumble grumble) and then noticed I had their standard feed addy provided by their platform. After updating around 30 feeds last night, I realized I should do the same. How could I be so off the bandwagon?

Well, now I&#8217;m on and available at this address:

So who are the **17 Hippies**? One of my favorite bands, straight outta Berlin. Here&#8217;s a press release snapshot:

They&#8217;re an eclectic mix of folk music, polka, brass and pop. The vocals are in German, French and English.
