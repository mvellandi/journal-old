Laura Ries wrote an excellent article after having come back with Al from a trip to Beijing&#8230;go check it out.

Some excellent points are made in her court&#8230;and I&#8217;m on her side for most product/service categories. I once thought heavily extended store brands might prove to be an exception. Costco&#8217;s Kirkland Signature brand sells extremely well (although that&#8217;s a special [story](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FNP/is_23_44/ai_n15969670 "article on Kirkland Signature private label Costco brand") of its own), in addition to Target and IKEA&#8217;s brands. But in the end, if retail shoppers are willing to purchase items where price & economy are not strong purchasing influencers&#8230;they&#8217;ll often choose the items with the unique brand name and packaging.

But back to China. I think Theory A is vastly superior and just plain more exciting from a buyer&#8217;s point of view, especially in the realm of FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods). I think electronics however, is a unique category where the normal rules don&#8217;t easily apply; buyers want to trust a brand they&#8217;re forking out more money to. Would you like a Sylvania or a Samsung?

Time will tell what will happen in China. I can&#8217;t make any educated guesses yet, but I&#8217;ll toss in some change after I finish reading [China Inc](http://www.amazon.com/China-Inc-Superpower-Challenges-America/dp/0743257359/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-0420155-4782442?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1179562744&sr=8-1 "China Inc book on Amazon"). by Ted Fishman (highly recommended!).
