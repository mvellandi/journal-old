<img src="../images/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/metea.jpg" />That&#8217;s Italian for intermission and is something I&#8217;m taking until July.

Right now, I need to fully delve into the final four weeks of delivering a fantastic website for my client. This involves a LOT of copywriting on my behalf, designing info graphics, and delivering the best experience on time. What&#8217;s it all about? New product development and launch services for healthcare consumer products. That&#8217;s my evening/ weekend job, after working days in admin for an aerospace project mgmt consulting firm (for another 6 weeks).

In the interim period I also plan on

  * Catching up on the design and business mags piling up in my office
  * Exercising, hiking, and meditating according to a planned schedule
  * Developing a photo slideshow solution for an [national nonprofit&#8217;s event](http://taste.strength.org/site/PageServer?pagename=TOTN_homepage "Taste of the Nation website")
  * Participating in the June [MP Bookclub event](http://www.marketingprofs.com/preview/?id=41&adref=bookclub "Marketing Profs book club")
  * Joining a chamber of commerce (thanks to Lewis)
  * Catch up with old pals, network associates and perhaps some new folks through [Upcoming.org](http://www.upcoming.org "Upcoming.org website") and [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com "Meetup.com website")

Taking my place will be Jalal Bourgana, a former colleague and good friend. He&#8217;s a Moroccan-born Supply Chain exec with an alcohol and home decor manufacturer, and is transitioning to new product development. He thinks a lot like me, so I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll enjoy his style.

Please give him a warm welcome.

Tanti cari saluti con un senso di sincera amicizia,

Mario
