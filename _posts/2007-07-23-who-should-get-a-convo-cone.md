<img src="/images/2008/aoc-cone.jpg" />In the spirit of community giving, I&#8217;d like to send 3 copies of the book to CMOs on our behalf. But who should I pick? I can&#8217;t deny any requests since this is from us&#8230;so make it good.

I&#8217;ll be the first&#8230;so I pick:

[Colgate-Palmolive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate-Palmolive "Wikipedia article on Colgate Palmolive")

I think this company can definitely use some help in making some better products that reflect consumer needs. But as from my page in the book, conversation can bring new ideas for improvement across a wide variety of company activities. Ultimately, I&#8217;d like to see this company step up to P&G&#8217;s level of product innovation. It will probably take a while, but that&#8217;s fine&#8230;they just need a little encouragement. (\*Gentle shove\* into the playground).

Who else would you like to see get a book?
