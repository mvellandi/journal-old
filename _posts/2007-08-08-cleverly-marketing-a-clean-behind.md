When you have to explain a product REALLY well so as to stir in people the slightest tinge of curiosity,

and you do it very creatively with great acting, compelling copy, and interactivity that is playful and amusing,

that is the ultimate high in marketing. Good design can make almost anything more appealing.

I sense there was a lot of time and passion devoted to the product concept and definition phase, a critical area in development. A solid product concept accompanied by its business case, establishes a unifying vision and organizational support for it. But still, we must try and use sticky elements in our communicating that vision. Otherwise, the message and concept will be interpreted by everyone differently, who then explain it to third parties in their own way, who then&#8230;.yeah&#8230;I think you get the idea.

Chip and Dan Heath advise using stories whenever possible. When introducing new products to others, it sure can help a lot&#8230;especially if that product/service category is full of &#8220;me-toos&#8221;. I&#8217;ll write about this again at a future date. In the meantime, I&#8217;d like you to check out the following website and share what you like about it.

I particularly like the xylophone effect when you roll over the people&#8217;s faces on the main navigation.

What about you?
