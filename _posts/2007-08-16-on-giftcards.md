Sara Cantor of the [Curious Shopper](http://curiousshopper.blogspot.com/ "Sara Cantor's blog"), wrote a [well-written piece](http://curiousshopper.blogspot.com/2007/08/solving-better-problem.html "article on retail gift cards and personalization") on designing better gift cards. To her, they&#8217;re very practical for the giver and receiver, however the feeling is a bit impersonal. Ok, we smarties know that complementing a gift card with a note or &#8216;regular card&#8217;?! is the obvious quick personalization tool we can use to show that extra TLC. But what else can we do?

The gift card is the one product that retailers have complete design dominion over. First there was an option to choose a different card design, but who really cares about that? Sara shows an example of a nice &#8216;experience set&#8217; that formed the environment of a card she purchased, but which ultimately didn&#8217;t do the trick for her. I thought it was well designed, but ah well&#8230;I had to read more, and she got me thinking of the possibilities advanced web tools retailers could use on their website to make some really nifty gift experiences. If people can make their own custom postcards, stickers and correspondence/business cards with [Moo](http://www.moo.com/ "Moo photo and business cards website"), well there should be a lot of additional personalization options to retailers who are willing to step up to the plate and look into printing & fulfillment outsourcing options that are available.

If any of you have stories or examples of personalized gift cards and related experiences, please share!
