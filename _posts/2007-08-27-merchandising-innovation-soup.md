A little over a year ago while shopping at Target, I noticed some standard Campbell&#8217;s chicken noodle cans in a dispensing container. Then I recently saw the same devices used at my local Albertsons supermarket.

Allowing the product&#8217;s features to be prominently displayed with bigger text and imagery, helps shoppers easier see the variety of choices they have and make a quicker purchasing decision. This readability is particularly helpful to older shoppers, whose eyes aren&#8217;t as light receptive as their younger counterparts.

In a category like soup, visuals are important in arousing emotional appeal, thereby increasing the propensity to buy. Traditional soup lovers are greater convenienced, other shoppers take greater notice, and total category sales will grow.

What else I like is that the product always appears orderly. Re-facing products can be a chore. In fast-moving consumer goods, it&#8217;s just a necessity. Items need to be moved to the front and the shelf should look in order. More facings in the visual shelf-estate leads to greater notice. But this process costs employees time, which they could be using for service in the daytime. With this system, everything&#8217;s taken care of.

Kind of geeky topic, I know&#8230;and it isn&#8217;t exactly a new invention. But this does represent a unique way of merchandising products that affects both retail sales and operations.
