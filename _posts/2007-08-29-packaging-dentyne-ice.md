My friend and I picked up some gum a few nights ago and took notice of the nice packaging treatment. Normally, you&#8217;d have either the foiled plastic pushouts (ala medicine style), the thin strip packs (Wrigley), or a style similar to the one below except stacked single-row with edges facing.

What I really like about it is the presentation. It seems like you&#8217;re carrying a little portfolio of gum pieces in a suitcase. With the large gum side facing, you see more of the wrapper&#8217;s design (something we&#8217;d normally never notice). In all, I get the feeling I&#8217;m supposed to take a bit more care and try to enjoy each piece.
