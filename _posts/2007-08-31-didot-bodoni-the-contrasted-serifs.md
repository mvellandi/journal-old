This font belongs to a class of serifs known as [didone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didone "Wikipedia article on Didone fonts") or modern, and are distinguished for their highly variable stroke width, or contrast. Why they&#8217;re called modern, is beyond my understanding&#8230;but I guess the name stuck. Very similar to [Didot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didot_%28typeface%29 "Wikipedia article on Didot typeface") is another font called [Bodoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodoni "Wikipedia article on Bodoni typeface"), developed by an Italian named [Giambattista Bodoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_Bodoni "Wikipedia article on Giambattista Bodoni") in 1798.

What I love about these fonts is their elegance; you&#8217;ll often see them used for luxury items and environments. One easy example to imagine is &#8220;Giorgio Armani&#8221;. But because of their extreme contrast, they aren&#8217;t good for screen displays nor small print because it&#8217;ll be very hard to read and the serifs will disappear. Generally though, a font publisher may have a &#8220;display&#8221; version appropriate to your needs.

Another example of modern fonts is shown here using their thicker versions:

This is Poster Bodoni, which evokes a very different feeling: stylish, retro or 70s funky.
