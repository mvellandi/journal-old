Early last month, [MI5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi5 "wikipedia article on mi5") called me at my bungalow in the Cayman Islands to let me know 009 (aka &#8216;[The Conversation Agent](http://www.conversationagent.com "the conversation agent, Valeria Maltoni")&#8216;) wanted to arrange a meeting of minds. I happily agreed and we exchanged dialogue about marketing, retail, and psychology. The Russians and Chinese tried to intercept the transmissions, but we successfully dodged them and divided the conversation into a 2-part series: Signal 1 and Signal 2

Enjoy!
