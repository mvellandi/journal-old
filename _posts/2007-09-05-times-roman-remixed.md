Normally, I find this font boring. It was designed by Stanley Morrison in 1931 for the Times of London, to provide excellent readability for high-speed printing on low quality paper. I will acknowledge its power as a workhorse typeface. For print though, I prefer [Caslon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caslon "wikipedia article on the caslon typeface")&#8230;.but that&#8217;s beside the point of my post today.

What I did want to point out was the beauty of this typeface online and offline, under particular conditions. First, increase the size, then reduce the [kerning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning "wikipedia article on kerning") (the proportional spacing between characters). Note: The ability to adjust kerning is available in desktop publishing software like Quark or InDesign (but not MS Word). For online, it is only available when using CSS. Lastly, it&#8217;s also available in Image editing software. I used Adobe Fireworks CS3 for the example shown below; the sizes are in 48, 58, and 90 (top to bottom), and kerned at -6.

One more thing about Times, if you use it in bold it will look hideous&#8230;but that&#8217;s just me.

Also online, for all general purposes you&#8217;re best off using the font [Georgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28typeface%29 "wikipedia article on the typeface georgia"). In some cases where a large typeface allows, Times may suit you better.

__P.S.__ &#8211; I&#8217;m not claiming to be a pro typographer, it&#8217;s just one artistic interest. If I&#8217;m wrong somewhere or you have any recommendations, please leave me a comment below. Thanks!
