[Fellowforce](http://www.fellowforce.com "Fellowforce open innovation and ideation community website") is a community platform / idea exchange for organizations and creative thinkers. The basic process works like this:

  1. Organizations can post challenges they&#8217;re facing in an effort to solicit innovative ideas and solutions, in exchange for a specified reward/prize.
  2. Community members can review available challenges and pitch their creative solutions to the problem.
  3. Organizations review the bidding ideas and select the best solution.
  4. Winning member receives the specified reward.

This all sounds very neat, but how are ideas protected? I guess there&#8217;s a certain degree of trust and perhaps the winner reveals more info after they&#8217;ve been selected.

Outsourced-innovation is a very hot-growing industry. Did you know BMW has its own outsourced design company? They&#8217;re called [Designworks](http://www.designworksusa.com/ "BMW Designworks USA website") and have been around for at least 8 years.

**Have you seen any similar applications of idea-generation outsourcing? Social media and user communities have been used for product development and testing before. What are your thoughts on this? Do you see any pitfalls or concerns?**
