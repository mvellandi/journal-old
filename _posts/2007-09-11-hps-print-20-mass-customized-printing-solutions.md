Well, just a few days after covering [Amazon&#8217;s CreateSpace](http://www.createspace.com/) in a [previous article](../amazons-createspace/ "article on Amazon's CreateSpace"), I come to learn about [HP&#8217;s Print 2.0 strategy](http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2007/070828xc.html "HP's news release on the Print 2.0 campaign and business strategy") first from Drew McLellan&#8217;s post. I was pleasantly surprised to see [Eric Kintz](http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/kintz/ "Eric Kintz's blog") himself (Vice President of Marketing, Digital Photography and Entertainment for HP), reply to my pondering on fulfillment and channel strategy.

Monsieur Eric, etes vous Francais?

So I did a Google blog search of course to find out more. Here is some additional links for your delightful reading pleasure:

Okay, so printing options are exploding&#8230;that&#8217;s a given. I see 3 enablers are making this happen: software, lean digital-publishing, and a tight logistics/distribution system.

The big question is on how VARs (value-added resellers) and retailers are going to be reacting in their own regard. Partner with HP, make your own model, or a combination of both? That will depend on the unique business opportunity presented and what other options are available. Wal-Mart is already using [SnapFish](http://www.snapfish.com/ "HP's snapfish online photo organization service") by HP for the software, and digital printing and shipping by Fuji.

I&#8217;d like to know what Costco, Target, CVS, Rite-Aid, and Walgreens have up their sleeves. Are their standard photo services just enough? What is the sales potential of custom photo books? I would have to say there&#8217;s a huge potential there. Building your own photo album (supplies & time) can be a chore. However, you really have to present the consumer with a menu of what&#8217;s possible and price it accordingly. You have to create that vision beyond the 30 second commercial. Establishments must have displays that explains how the process works and have a few live samples on hand.

In all, I wish all parties luck. This is an exciting time to be in for digital publishing. Will HP become the Dell for printing? We&#8217;ll have to wait and see&#8230;
