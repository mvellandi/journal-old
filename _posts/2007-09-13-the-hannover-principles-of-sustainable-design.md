<img src="../images/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/sustainableleaf-sm1.jpg" alt="a leaf" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />First developed in 1992 by architect [William McDonough](http://www.mcdonough.com/ "william mcdonough's website") and German chemist [Michael Braungart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Braungart "wikipedia article on Michael Braungart"), the [Hannover Principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannover_Principles "wikipedia article on the Hannover Principles") set out to address our interdependence with nature, and how we can use design to better protect and improve our environment. These guidelines aren&#8217;t just meant for industrial designers, engineers, architects and others with a hand in creation or maintenance; they also include you, your organization, your suppliers and customers.

I first came across them through a [6 part audio series](http://www.ndbroadcasting.org/search.php?q=monticello "the monticello dialogues from new dimensions media") called the Monticello Dialogues, where William McDonough is interviewed on the topics of design and sustainability on the [Monticello estate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello "wikipedia article on monticello"), the home of Thomas Jefferson.

Here are the Hannover Principles with additional commentary as interpreted from the interviews:

### Insist on the Rights of Nature and Humanity to Co-Exist

The conditions for the shared environment of mankind and nature should be healthy, mutually supportive, diverse and sustainable. It is our personal responsibility to be an active participant in the process, and not simply hope someone else is doing/will do something about it. We have to insist on Design to ensure this co-existence is possible. ____

### Recognize Interdependence

We are dependent on the natural world to enable our activities. How we interact with it has diverse implications at every scale that in the design process should be considered for the near and long-term.

### Respect Relationships between Spirit and Matter

Among indigenous people across the world, this is the only principle that matters and which governs our actions. It can be a bit tricky, as certain advances in biochemistry for example have raised ethical questions on man&#8217;s meddling with nature.

### Accept Responsibility for the Consequences of Design

Instead of paying most attention to the _Rights_ of Man, we should be focusing on our _Responsibilities_. Rights are fuzzy when it comes to where we draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Individuals, governments and corporations all interpret rights differently. As a result, laws and regulation have served as a reasonable arbiter. However, the problem of these instruments is that they don&#8217;t apply equally to all parties. Responsibility is largely diffused and diminished as we move from the individual to the larger organizational level. The solution is to fix the design so no regulation is needed. This means designing products and processes that can do no harm.

### Create Safe Objects of Long-Term Value

Don&#8217;t burden future generations with maintenance, cleanup, and support activities for objects that present long-term liabilities. Nuclear power is one example.

### Eliminate the Concept of Waste

We should try and reach toward zero waste, not just being more efficient. Eco-efficiency is a noble goal, sure. You recognize what&#8217;s bad, and try to be less bad. But that&#8217;s not pushing the envelope far enough. The human capacity for creativity in design has allowed us to reach some previously inconceivable accomplishments. We can do more through a mindset toward eco-effectiveness.

### Rely on Natural Energy Flows

Like the natural world, human design should look toward the sun as a reliable source of energy. (I&#8217;ll expand on this to include the secondary effects of the sun on geophysics, namely hydro and wind energy).

### Understand the Limitations of Design

Nature is a model and mentor for man, not a force to be sidestepped, controlled, or manipulated. Although design can do wondrous things, all human creations are impermanent, and thus design isn&#8217;t a panacea for all problems. Those of us who help develop and plan should practice humility to remind us that we are only human, and there are limitations to what we can do and the to lifespan of our creations.

### Seek Constant Improvement by the Sharing of Knowledge

Build and encourage open dialogue between yourself and others in establishing a connection between long-term sustainable considerations with ethical responsibility, while promoting the interdependence between nature and human activity.

I really liked what McDonough had to share. If you listen to the dialogue or pick up he and his partner&#8217;s book, _Cradle to Cradle_, they&#8217;ll share with you their vision of a future where the byproducts of products and processes are nutritional and helpful. Before I veer into the subjective unknown, here are some links for further information:
