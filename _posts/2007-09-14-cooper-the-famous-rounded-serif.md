I&#8217;ve seen this stubby serif growing up in dozens of places, just like you. Be it the original &#8220;Payless Shoes&#8221;, pizza parlors, TV shows, and wherever else. [This Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Black "Wikipedia article on the Cooper typeface") on the Cooper typeface tells a lot more about its history and use in popular culture. The thinner version of this font is from [Bitstream](http://www.bitstream.com "Bitstream type foundry").
