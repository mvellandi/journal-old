A few weeks ago, I came across this traditional method of folding fabric over objects as a form of packaging / bagging known as [Furoshiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furoshiki "wikipedia article on furoshiki"). While the videos I found were removed (GoogleVideo It!), here&#8217;s a picture I&#8217;ve found (**click for larger image**) describing different folding methods. Enjoy!
