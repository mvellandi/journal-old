I remember back from my college days seeing [Factiva](http://www.factiva.com "Factiva market research website") and a variety of research providers on our library network; it was interesting. I didn&#8217;t use them often though, as I just went through the assigned case studies and looked up 10ks, 10qs, and used Yahoo Finance among other sources (in research, one fact/clue always leads to another!).

Two years ago, I managed a SalesForce.com trial and implementation plan at a former position and got to learn of the possibilities of bringing in subscribed content/functionality with third party providers. The connection? Well, not something so astonishing&#8230;but interesting in its own Zen reality of the marketplace and current situation. I typed in an old Factiva link from an older book of mine on Competitive Intelligence, and I&#8217;m brought to this page&#8230;which led me to explore more. So yes with CRM and other enterprise systems, the whole &#8220;Intelligence and Research&#8221; at your fingertips for a nominal subscription plan package is available. All ready and available as a module into whatever kind of process you&#8217;re using.

Seems so powerful and liberating a service&#8230;..whoah ahhhhh. Yet I know from my dirty research methods (they&#8217;re really clean&#8230;I just like to think crafty), and one of my friends is that the value of intelligence is highly variable on the context and need. &#8220;How much is enough?&#8221; is another story, but great research is a challenge. And with learning the various tools and gaining experience, we can reduce cycle-time and become more productive and responsive to data -> intelligence requests.

In all, since I love the power of information to help people become educated and do better work, I think it&#8217;s just awesome that such data services like Factiva and others (Wikipedia too!) exist to the extent they do&#8230;even if a lot of it is just quick company profiling 😉
