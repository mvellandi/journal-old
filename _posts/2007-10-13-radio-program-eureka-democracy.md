Just listened to a BBC radio program on open innovation models, titled [Eureka Democracy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/news.shtml?radio4/inbusiness "Eureka Democracy") (15 min).

Well worth the listen. They speak with people from Lego, P&G, and some scholars on this emerging field (which I&#8217;ve been following through [Wikinomics](http://www.amazon.com/Wikinomics-Mass-Collaboration-Changes-Everything/dp/1591841380/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-6942077-0716920?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192319119&sr=8-1 "Wikinomics book on Amazon"), [Mavericks at Work](http://www.amazon.com/Mavericks-Work-Original-Minds-Business/dp/B000TYL62I/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6942077-0716920?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192319187&sr=1-1 "Mavericks at Work book on amazon"), and elsewhere).
