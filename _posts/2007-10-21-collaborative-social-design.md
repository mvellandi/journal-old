While reading through my latest [I.D. magazine](http://www.idonline.com/ "International Design Magazine"), I came across two very interesting organizations that act as communities for social design projects. Very cool and similar to the open innovation networks out there.

#### <a title="Design21 social design network" href="http://www.design21sdn.com">Design21</a>

Founded by Japanese design retailer [Felissimo](http://www.felissimo.com "Felissimo design retailer website") in partnership with [UNESCO](http://www.unesco.org/ "UNESCO website") (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), this community site offers design [competitions](http://www.design21sdn.com/competitions "Design21 competitions"), news, and member discussions.

#### <a title="Open Architecture Network" href="http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/">Open Architecture Network</a>

A forum for architects to review and rate [projects](http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/projects) by others, participate in 3 open [challenges](http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/challenge), find and connect with other [members](http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/people), and contribute and share [resources](http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/resources).
