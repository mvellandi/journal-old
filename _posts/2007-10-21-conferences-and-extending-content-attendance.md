After recently speaking with a pal, we discussed the use of online social tools for b2b purposes. I thought about the variety of conferences hosted by b2b trade associations, and how they could really offer more value to their visitors/companies. So one easy avenue I thought of was live video streaming, which [Jeremiah](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/ "Jeremiah Owyang's blog") and others online have discussed before; primary example being [uStream](http://www.ustream.tv/ "uStream.tv"), an established enabler and host of live video and community chat services.

So of course there have oft been conferences that have offered tapings/recordings usually for an extended fee. I&#8217;m betting live video streaming will become more common. The A/V production quality will be great, tied into an extended communication tech platform that forms part of the online visitor experience. I see a possible scenario as follows:

A company is able to send 3 employees to a conference, and decides to purchase 8 virtual seats. Two senior managers get all day/area passes; Two departmental managers get 10-session packages; Four various employees get 6-session packages.

Each session is live streamed and recorded for later viewing (within one week). Presentational Content (slides, notes, graphs, etc) is available in the session &#8216;room&#8217; sometime after the session has concluded. Chat functionality and visitor profiles are available. After the week is up, custom DVDs can be created from selected sessions for a nominal amount. These will be processed/fulfilled by 3rd party providers (similar to Amazon&#8217;s [CreateSpace](http://www.createspace.com "CreateSpace website")).

I like the opportunity it presents for conferences to extend attendance and the reach of their content through breaking up the product into smaller pieces for people to try out. I won&#8217;t go into further possibilities of online chats, bulletin boards, career centers, sponsors&#8217; booths etc, which is another subject of its own. Checking out the [MarketingProfs](http://www.marketingprofs.com "MarketingProfs website") virtual show back in June was cool enough as a great demo.

**What do you think of the implications and potential? Have you seen some interesting applications used thusfar by trade associations or conference hosts?**
