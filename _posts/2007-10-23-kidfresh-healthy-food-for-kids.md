  - Childrens food retailer KidFresh is a great retail store concept with its design of healthy foods for kids. Is it a bit too niche though?

<img src="../images/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/kidfreshplate.jpg" alt="happy kid food" hspace="15" vspace="15" align="left" />An interesting retail concept I came across recently, [Kidfresh](http://www.kidfresh.com/ "Kidfresh website") is a single store in NYC that sells healthy food for kids in manner that has **FUN** written all over it. From looking at their online store, it appears they&#8217;re likely making their Kidfresh brands in-house and having the packaging shipped in. All the other brands are going to be procured from distributors like [United National Foods](http://www.unfi.com "United Natural Foods Inc."), or purchased from regional producers.

I almost see it as a specialty offshoot of Whole Foods, appropriate for urban/posh parents looking for some fun for their kids, while taking delight in the shopping experience itself. While I really like the retail concept, I have to wonder about its extendability. How convenient would it be to have parents shop here AND at a general supermarket?

Kidfresh&#8217;s best bet is expanding the store perhaps to 10 cities, while exploring the much bigger opportunity of mass-producing their house brand for bigger food retailers.

**What do you think?**
