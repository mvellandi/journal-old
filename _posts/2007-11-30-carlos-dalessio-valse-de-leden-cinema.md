One of those is classical compositions. Today I would like to share with you a song by an Argentinian-born, French theater composer by the name of Carlos D&#8217;Alessio. Examples of his work &#8211; other than a 1992 film soundtrack &#8211; are very hard to find.

I hope you enjoy this piece, and that it may awaken some livened spirit within you!
