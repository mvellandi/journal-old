It can reside in a website and/or through a desktop application that connects to the web.

Adobe is leading the charge in creating the frameworks for developers to create RIAs. Flash is the well-known browser plugin that&#8217;s allowed us to experience some very interactive websites for a while now. About 6 years ago, they included features for working with webcams, microphones, and storing local data. A few years later came Flex, a platform for creating RIAs based on Flash technology. Earlier this year, Adobe released Apollo, a cross operating system runtime environment for RIAs on the desktop. It&#8217;s been renamed AIR, and is currently in beta until its official launch in Spring of 2008.

I am a big fan of RIAs and the AIR platform because they allow the user experience to be more personal. Lightweight applications can be run independently of what operating system you&#8217;re using, can exchange data and multimedia with online services, and can be run offline as well.

Remember, remarkable products and services and built with the user in mind. Tech is the just the engineering. Excellent design and a strong market orientation are critical to the success of any product that people will adore and tell their friends about 🙂
