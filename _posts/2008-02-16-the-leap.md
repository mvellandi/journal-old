_&#8220;If I love who we are, and if I love what we can be, then I&#8217;ll love the process of how we get there. And in order to make it all happen, I will act boldly and courageously and I will, at times, fail magnificently. But my love demands that I try. Demands it.&#8221;_

_&#8220;that&#8217;s the nature of leadership in the extreme: the dynamic interplay of love and fear. Acting out of love creates fear, and love gives me the courage to work through that fear.&#8221;_

### LEAP &#8211; Love, Energy, Audacity, Proof

_&#8220;Love generates Energy, inspires Audacity, and requires Proof. LEAP, you see, is simply the Extreme Leader&#8217;s active, dynamic, expression of love.&#8221;_

_&#8220;The Extreme Leader consciously and intentionally cultivates love in order to generate boundless energy and inspire courageous audacity. And he or she must provide the proof that it&#8217;s all been worthwhile: proof through the alignment between word and action; proof through the standing up for what&#8217;s right; proof through measurable, tangible signs of progress; and proof through the experience of phenomenal success as well as glorious failure. That&#8217;s the LEAP. And, if I can add to that, it&#8217;s the LEAP that creates the OS!M [Oh Shit! Moment]. The OS!M is fear in the pursuit of creating something greater than the current reality. And the desire to create something greater is a bold expression of love. Simple as that.&#8221;_
