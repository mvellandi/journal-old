This is the model that Robert G. Cooper established in the early 80s to describe a systematic approach toward developing new products. For a comprehensive examination, please read his [book on Stage Gate Product Development and Innovation Strategy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738204633?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0738204633). The model was the result of three companies who approached him and asked to research their processes and establish a common best-practices framework; they were DuPont, Nortel Networks, and Pratt & Whitney. While the basic underlying principles of a development process have long been around, Cooper established a framework that also included project review sessions known as &#8220;Gates&#8221; and/or &#8220;Decision Diamonds&#8221;. The entire model is also known as a Phased Review model (among other names), and is commonly referred to as such in academic and commercial settings due to the trademarking of the name.

The following links are posts I&#8217;ve written that cover these phases:<a title="Discovery or Ideation process in new product development" href="../discovery-the-pursuit-of-breakthrough-ideas/"></a>

  * **[Discovery](../discovery-the-pursuit-of-breakthrough-ideas/ "Discovery or Ideation process in new product development")**
  * **[Idea Screening](../idea-screening/ "Idea screening in new product development")**
  * **[Scoping](../scoping/ "scoping or concept analysis in new product development")**
  * **[Building the Business Case & Plan](../building-the-business-case-plan/ "the business case and plan phase in new product development")**
  * **[Development](../a-brief-note-on-development/ "the development phase in new product development")**
  * **[Testing & Validation](../testing-validation/ "testing and validation in new product development")**

Because the _Launch_ phase involves many differing factors and activities that are different for each product category, I will not be covering it. However, I do have [a diagram that outlines how a marketing plan is developed](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mvellandi/2326472490/ "Marketing Plan diagram on Flickr"). This is a &#8216;living document&#8217; that is created within the Business Case & Plan phase, and updated throughout the NPD process. A related topic that is formed between the Business Case and Development phases, is a [new product design strategy](../new-product-design-strategy/ "what a new product design strategy might entail").

The next post on this topic will cover what the &#8216;Gates&#8217; are all about.
