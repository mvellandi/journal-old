<img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px 20px 10px 0pt; float: left;" src="/images/2008/telescope.jpg" alt="telescope" />Continuing with my series of posts on Steve Farber&#8217;s [&#8220;The Radical Leap&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/Radical-Leap-Personal-Extreme-Leadership/dp/0793185688/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204692573&sr=8-1 "The Radical Leap by Steve Farber on Amazon"), today I&#8217;ll quote and review some dialog about the source of love and inspiration individuals need to develop energy they can channel into their work.

The narrator and his companion are on the beach playing fetch with an enthusiastic dog. A stick is motivation enough for her to play, since there&#8217;s few activities she loves to play more than fetch. The companion says:

> _&#8220;..people are not dogs; we&#8217;re not content to spend our lives chasing sticks. We&#8217;re far more complex that that; yet, so many businesspeople throw sticks and expect others to fetch and come back again and again like good little doggies.&#8221;_

How we&#8217;ve all been subject to that at times, as if we&#8217;re kids happily receiving candy and toys in response to good behavior or rituals (birthdays, holidays). Sure, they&#8217;re perks. But ultimately all humans need attention, validation, a feeling of contributive worth, and at least a sense of purpose.

The narrator goes on to say that to energize and inspire masses, most leaders will give stout speeches, write rousing memos, print shirts, hang up posters, etc. The real kicker is the Vision, to which the companion adds:

> _&#8220;It&#8217;s become conventional wisdom that in order to get people excited about the present, you talk about the future, you have a vision statement. Problem is, most vision statements are way too incomplete at best, and cynic-inducing claptrap at worst&#8230;It&#8217;s easy to pump people up. But its usually a temporary phenomenon. Michael Cunningham, the novelist said, &#8216;If you shout loud enough, for long enough, a crowd will gather to see what all the noise is about. It&#8217;s the nature of crowds. They don&#8217;t stay long unless you give them reason&#8217;.&#8221;_

The companion goes on to say how most vision statements are formed by executive committees offsite, arguing over petty words, phrases, and trite expressions. When they&#8217;re done, they laminate it and hand it out to everyone in little wallet cards or place them on walls around the premises. He funnily says:

> _&#8220;It&#8217;s as if they expect the laminated card to work like a nicotine patch. Carry it close to your skin [or on your desk] and the energy will somehow get in your bloodstream&#8230;A vision statement doesn&#8217;t generate energy, love does, great ideas do, principles and values do. A vision statement that comes from a corporate exercise is about as energizing and memorable as a saltine cracker.&#8221;_

Next, the companion reasserts love generating energy, draws a circle of hearts around the narrator and him, posits that it&#8217;s the extreme leader&#8217;s job to connect all those hearts, and continues:

> _&#8220;Without that heart connection, you may have an employer-employee thing going on, or a bureaucratic boss-subordinate &#8216;relationship&#8217;. But people who don&#8217;t have that heart connection won&#8217;t try to change the world together. And if you&#8217;re not trying to change the world, you haven&#8217;t entered the realm of the Extreme Leader&#8221;._

The narrator then asks how to establish such a connection, to which his companion replies:

> _&#8220;By revealing yourself as a human being to those you hope to lead. So, instead of reciting a vision statement, reflect on the ideals that it represents, and take it all into your on heart. Then at every opportunity &#8211; whether you&#8217;re talking on-on-one or standing in front of a crowd &#8211; you say, in essence, &#8216;This is who I am, this is what I believe, this is what I think we can do together if we put our hearts into it. Look at how magnificent our future can be. Please join me and let&#8217;s help each other make this happen.&#8217; Then you can burn the document, because, in effect, you&#8217;ve become the vision.&#8221;_

Electric connections will ensue, because it&#8217;s honest, well-delivered, and sends an impacting blow to those around. Now that makes a lot of sense. Sure, I&#8217;ve thought vision / mission statements were lame at times, but I understand the good intention was oftentimes there. This story made me think much more about effective delivery techniques that resonate strength and authenticity, while kicking banality and generic hope to the curb.

One CEO I worked for delivered this passion and purpose of the company exceptionally well; other department heads could too (except for mine). The little placards around the building didn&#8217;t mean too much because all of us understood our roles and commitment to paying fanatical attention to the needs of prospects and clients, while seeking to make the most innovative and unique products retailers would love. That was our common purpose and what we strove to do everyday.
