While I&#8217;ve liked [**Futura**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_%28typeface%29 "Wikipedia article on Futura typeface") for a while, especially having seen it around from street signage to books, I recently came across Avenir and liked the bit more comfortable look. [Avenir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenir "Wikipedia article on Avenir typeface") was designed by [Adrian Frutiger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Frutiger "Wikipedia article on Adrian Frutiger") in 1988. He described it as:

> _&#8230;intended to be nothing more or less than a clear and clean representation of modern typographical trends, giving the designer a typeface which is strictly modern and at the same time human, i.e., suitably refined and elegant for use in texts of any length._

What&#8217;s also special is that each of its varieties (sizes and weights), were uniquely designed for versatility in different contexts, especially print where it is well regarded for use in books with large amounts of text.
