[age of conversation 2 banner](http://tinyurl.com/2drj2x "age of conversation amazon purchase link") The Age of Conversation had a great debut last year. Through our writers&#8217; and friends&#8217; collective efforts, our proceeds-from-sales to the children&#8217;s charity **[Variety](http://www.usvariety.org/ "variety children charity")** amounted to more than $11,000.

Now we&#8217;ve been able to bring this fine book to Amazon, and if you **[buy this book today](http://tinyurl.com/2drj2x "age of conversation on amazon purchase link")**, your effort will radically help drive the book&#8217;s attention up through Amazon&#8217;s charts -> leading to greater potential proceeds.

So if you don&#8217;t have a copy of last year&#8217;s classic, or know someone who might enjoy reading it (while helping out a great cause in the process), visit or forward on this special affiliate link:
