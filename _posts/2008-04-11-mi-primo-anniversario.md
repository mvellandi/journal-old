Just a little over a year ago, on April 4th, I began writing this blog.

Before jumping in, I spent a LOT of time commenting on blog posts (just about everywhere!) and getting to know the various individuals that write exceptionally well AND connect to their readers.

Then I began organizing the big blogroll you see in the right margin. Its prominence is intentional &#8211; many of these writers deserve attention for their passion; some of them have helped me come to where I am today &#8211; please explore!

I started off slow and didn&#8217;t write as often as I wanted to. Perfectionism haunted my spirit as I didn&#8217;t want to come off as a person writing blurbs and editorial. The purpose of an excellent blog is to flesh out what stirs excitement within you while providing a conversational atmosphere to share and learn from others.

After one year, it has been a fantastic experience. Thank-you for your kindness and acceptance of me. Special gratitude go to <a title="Mario Sundar Marketing Nirvana" href="http://mariosundar.wordpress.com/">Mario Sundar</a> and <a title="Christina Kerley blog" href="http://www.ck-blog.com/">CK</a>
