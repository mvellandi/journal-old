After one week since Blogger Social, it&#8217;s been great looking back at the whole experience. The only general expectations I had would be that everyone would be really friendly and smart in their own regards. While this held true, there were other things I noticed and felt. In follow-up to being tagged by [Ryan Barrett of CheapThrills](http://ryanbarrett.typepad.com/cheapthrills/ "Ryan Barrett of CheapThrills"), it is these feelings that I&#8217;d like to share:

* As much as I wanted to try to speak with everyone at least briefly, there just wasn&#8217;t enough time. But I damned made sure to do the best I could; only about 10 people got away because of different schedules, seating, timing, etc. There were some dear folks with whom I had wanted to spend more personal time with &#8211; our interaction was circumstantially brief &#8211; and which left me a little sad. However, this difference of wanted v. actual time used, ended up with me having excellent conversations and dialog with individuals &#8211; on an unanticipated intellectual or social plane, and a few times on a personal and extended basis.  

* The informal blogger profile booklet really helped in quickly getting to know everyone and identifying individuals I had wanted to speak with. It was this complete picture of professional and personal background information, painted by an impartial 3rd party, that made everyone seem so human and approachable &#8211; regardless of what industry we came from, what stage of life we&#8217;re in, our relative &#8216;success&#8217; level, etc. Secondly, the informal profiles immensely helped shorten &#8216;small talk to conversation&#8217; cycle time (Yes, I am a process/productivity geek &#8211; time is valuable; let&#8217;s make the most of it).  

* While there was a LOT of enthusiastic conversing going on, there were also a couple times when I felt general content and satisfaction in the air without the need for words during little mini-breaks; maybe a few folks were around us, but there was no awkward rift, no pressure to start conversation again right away &#8211; the small talk was truly genuine and had a pace of its own. That feeling was extremely comforting.  

* Speaking with and listening to so many individuals from a variety of professional backgrounds and experiences, helped really exhibit the relative nature of all reality. In a mixed social setting with no professionally organized agenda (explicit and implied), we&#8217;ll all dramatically contribute to the very healthy and important virtue of open-mindedness, while seeing each others&#8217; professions and point-of-views in new ways (or at least be more inclined to).  

* I came away with a better understanding of what my unique passions are, where my strengths lie, in which direction I want to drive forward, and realistic idea of how to get there. What is my passion and career direction you may ask? It&#8217;s heavily leaning toward green marketing, innovation, and sustainable product development. But as I learned from a few folks, opening our minds to diverse and different work opportunities can also help us grow in ways perhaps we&#8217;ve never considered before. The path is never quite straight, nor must it be.  

* Time is now more valuable than ever before &#8211; Any and all acquaintances and friends I decide to maintain online, must have some level of genuine &#8216;interestingness&#8217; or geniality. Novelty is not an option (unless it&#8217;s so remarkable and entertaining, while not interfering with my ability to be professionally and socially productive). If I have an opportunity to develop a future relationship with someone I have only very weak ties now, I&#8217;ll let it develop on its own accord and timing.

With all that said, it was an amazing experience that I will cherish. For all the folks I met last weekend, previously &#8216;known&#8217; and unknown, it was marvelous meeting you and I hope that we may remain in good company for a very long time. ðŸ™‚

For all the dear individuals I know online, but whom I&#8217;ve not yet had the pleasure to meet or speak with, I look forward to an opportunity with you someday soon.
