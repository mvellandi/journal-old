. . .
A model for concept development I put together, as part of a weekly series of info diagrams from different designers, marketers, and other creative types. The series is called &#8220;Think Draw Make&#8221;, the website is [www.thinkdrawmake.com](http://www.thinkdrawmake.com "Think Draw Make info diagrams") , and is organized by [DT of DesignSojourn.com](http://www.designsojourn.com "DT of DesignSojourn.com")

Here is my official explanation of the diagram, as left by my comment at ThinkDrawMake:

> My inspiration is from product development phases, with the understanding of â€˜productâ€™ as being wide open to include objects (physical and intangible) for commercial, nonprofit, personal, and communal use.
>
> The word â€˜Marketâ€™ may imply designing an object for commercial use only. However, it could be stretched so that we simply mean looking at non-competitive objects elsewhere in the world. This may be done for noting best practices, styling, and other inputs into concept development.
>
> ##### In the diagram, multiple ideas are thought out then each is examined against:
>
> &#8211; Objective or Scope

> &#8211; Quality (as a function of time, cost, and absolute value)

> &#8211; Strategic Fit (organizational or personal values, culture, intended future direction)
>
> If the idea passes that preliminary intuitive test, then itâ€™s a good â€˜Conceptâ€™. These will then be further explored and refined through detailed descriptions, models (drawings, 3d forms, etc.), research, and viability analysis.
>
> The second screen simply asks which concepts are worth making, given our scope, their viability, attractiveness, and whatever constraints we may have (time, money, etc.).
>
> Then we build prototypes and lastly, finished objects. In the diagram, we began with 5 ideas and ended up building 2. I donâ€™t want to make the whole process seem too disciplined or difficult &#8211; but hey thatâ€™s life &#8211; to make great objects we have to be a little critical, you know? Money and time doesnâ€™t grow on trees ðŸ™‚
