This presented a big problem for him because he needed cellular service, but didn&#8217;t want to buy a new phone, nor pay overseas roaming fees. Prepaid SIM cards though, are difficult to find. American telecoms either sell service contracts combined with subsidized new phones (most often the case), OR monthly plans to customers with unlocked phones (seldom). For more information, please see _<a title="Stopwatch Marketing by John Rosen and AnnaMaria Turano" href="http://www.amazon.com/Stopwatch-Marketing-Charge-Customer-Decides/dp/1591841941/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1208651380&sr=8-1">Stopwatch Marketing</a>_ by John Rosen and AnnaMaria Turano, p.76-82.

While I understand the economics and customer &#8216;lock-in&#8217; strategy, I have two major contentions with this traditional business practice. One: It isn&#8217;t customer-oriented because people are not being given the freedom of handset model/maker choice; (Aside: _Hey Alltel! This is a huge differentiation opportunity if you don&#8217;t already offer it_).

Two: If new phone sales are subsidized through service plan changes, promotional upgrade offers, and new carrier signups, could that perhaps mean that Americans are more inclined to upgrade to new phones and dispose of old ones, in comparison to other countries?

As a result, Americans are not only subject to shorten their cell phone&#8217;s life cycle through great advertising and a personal desire to own a better phone, but *ALSO* through national carriers&#8217; product marketing & sales models. What if an individual wants to sign up with a new carrier because they&#8217;ve moved, are seeking a better rate, the previous provider&#8217;s customer service sucks&#8230;whatever the reason? If they are happy with their current phone, but it came from a previous carrier, it is the owner&#8217;s responsibility to try and seek out someone to unlock their phone (if possible), and then come back.

According to my own personal experience, and from _Stopwatch Marketing&#8217;s_ authors, the cellular service shopping experience is best characterized by reluctance (because of service plan complexity), and by a fast moving perception of time spent. With these factors at hand, it is no surprise that many individuals would see the option of purchasing their phone through non-traditional channels, or having phones unlocked through independent resellers, as too burdensome.

This presents an industry business model design with substantial negative externalities: a potentially higher per capita volume of cell phone e-waste in the United States, in comparison to other countries.
