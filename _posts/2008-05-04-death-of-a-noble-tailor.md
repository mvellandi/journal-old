Nau made fashionable clothing from sustainable & eco-friendly materials, and exclusively distributed them online and through retail stores in various U.S. cities. Their ethos resonated corporate social responsibility.

The preliminary autopsy report according to their press release pointed to a dissolution following an inability to procure additional capital investment, citing a risk-averse American financial market.

This week, I will gather my notes taken from a recent university seminar and will write about their story and operations.

As a fitting eulogy, I leave you with a small brochure that outlines their philosophy and can give you a personal glimpse into the company that was. May their energetic and caring spirit be carried on&#8230;
