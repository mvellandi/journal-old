One year ago, I wrote an article for a nonprofit multi-author book project called &#8220;[The Age of Conversation](http://www.amazon.com/Age-Conversation-Gavin-Heaton/dp/1847992994/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1210923463&sr=11-1 "Age of Conversation nonprofit book marketing")&#8220;. At the time, social media in the form of online blogs and other interactive/collaborative content was a very hot topic in sociology, journalism, and business circles among others.

While I saw the obvious benefit for social media tied to public relations and customer service, I tried to expand my mind beyond the traditional applications. After all, effective communication is important to every business/org function across a variety of industries. While many of these will not be conducive to blogging per se, there are other online applications that can be built and used as platforms for research and collaboration as well. Since I had originally worked in Sales & Product Development, while coordinating at times with Manufacturing and Logistics, I had a unique perspective on how new media &#8216;tools&#8217; could perhaps be used to improve communications among parties.

Blogging is but one tool; others may include polling, surveys, process documentation, creativity sessions, seminars, conference calls, remote meetings, design collaboration, multimedia sales presentations with feedback&#8230;the potential list can go on and on; and that&#8217;s where the fiery imagination can begin to stir, rubbing the hands, thinking: &#8220;How can what we&#8217;re doing now, somehow be done better?&#8221;. In an effort to expand the mind to potential online applications that employ conversation and discussion, I wrote the following article. If you enjoy it, please send it on to a friend who you&#8217;d think might enjoy it. ~Thanks.

The practice of research and inquiry has been with us throughout the ages. We have built intelligence by analyzing synthesized information and data, then adding personal insight and experience to make it relevant. Mankind has applied this common process for scientific, socio-economic, and political development in both positive and negative ways including the advancement of medicine, the harvesting and processing of food, and the art of war and provincial management.

Let’s add a unique dimension of this process: __Conversation__

Soliciting feedback and conducting polls is an excellent form of information gathering. By doing so, analysts and decision makers mitigate the risk of making bad judgments based on inconclusive data. When conducted correctly, the process will have an additional benefit: the establishment of trust, loyalty, and appreciation among all participants to the organization or cause.

The illustration shown, classifies voices into 5 major categories. By starting a conversation with the attitude of a desire to collaboratively create a better product, service, relationship or experience NOW…we exhibit our commitment to unconditional quality and being a true team player. Being firm and sincere will always win attention and command respect. Regarding competitors and antagonists, human behavior would normally not lend itself to voluntary cooperation and the sharing of feedback or intelligence. However, the improvement of common macro-level processes and goals has historically been a powerful incentive by nations, organizations, and individuals to collaborate so that the tide of excellence and well-being for all boats in the water will rise.

In order to obtain great data and information from your participants, we must follow some basic rules. First, each conversation should be customized to each audience category’s profile. Second, give immediate transparency to all submitted information to promote candor and more honest feedback among participants. Third, some form of descriptive data is absolutely necessary; polling is helpful but optional.

After individuals and organizers have collected, analyzed and created intelligence, they must further process it in order to draw value. This is the stage of stripping out ‘nice-to-knows’ and creating actionable intelligence, from which clear organizational and personal strategies can be made. The benefits can include competitive advantages, process improvements, better products/services, improved relationships with others, brand evangelists, and best of all: more goodwill to spread around for all to enjoy.

Now that you know the process, let’s just make it simple: Start a new conversation today. Be honest and open-minded…see where it takes you.
