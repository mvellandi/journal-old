Last Friday, I had the pleasure of attending a conference hosted by UCLA covering a variety of business topics related to sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and &#8216;green&#8217;. This panel looks at how marketing executives are devising strategies for shaping and managing their brands&#8217; eco-friendly profiles.

I videotaped the &#8216;Green Marketing Strategies&#8217; session, and broke up the hour discussion into 8 segments for the viewing pleasure at your pace and interests:
