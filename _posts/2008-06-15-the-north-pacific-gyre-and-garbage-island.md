[Vice magazine](http://www.viceland.com/ "vice magazine online") is putting out some fantastic video journalism covering culture, lifestyle, politics, the environment, and other topics.

Print and the written word work well for many topics, but for some: &#8220;seeing is really believing&#8221;.

This 12 part series they produced is on the massive underwater trash mass, north of Hawaii. Each video is very concise and runs about 5 min. Here&#8217;s the series introduction:
