### __Summary__

Julie highlights Dow&#8217;s Human Element campaign, and the company&#8217;s sustainability achievements and goals. It&#8217;s important for a chemical company nowadays to appropriately communicate who they are, what they do, and how they&#8217;re contributing to a better world (instead of unnecessarily polluting it, via the actions of further parties in the life cycle).

While I find the actual story to be good, the original television commercial was a bit glossy and emotional, and made me wonder if all of this was just a nice flowery smokescreen. Likely it isn&#8217;t, but one has to think about how advertisements might be perceived by the public. If we live in the age of authenticity and sustainability, it&#8217;s important for a huge multinational chemical corporation to communicate its message appropriately. Emotional appeal is nice, do it tactfully, but remember to give some substance in your promotional communications. First impressions count, and if you&#8217;re serious about your sustainability commitments, at least give a web address on the commercial for the cynics, informed and really interested viewers (in marketing & product development, we call them thought leaders, influentials, and lead users). That way you cover your bases and don&#8217;t leave a hole for critics to start judging you right away. While I haven&#8217;t seen some of the newer commercials Julie refers to, in addressing climate change for example, a great first step ensuring this web address can be seen and read in communication piece: dow.com/sustainability
