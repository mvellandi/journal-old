In this complete interview, Tibetan Buddhist leader His Holiness the Seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa reflects upon the meaning of oneness in this age. Noting how values of oneness hold the Tibetan culture in exile together, His Holiness describes how cultural cohesion has revivified the religious view of metaphysical oneness. His Holiness believes that religion and spirituality must adapt to reflect the evolving human condition, although root causes of suffering remain the same. Spiritual leaders and luminaries can facilitate this adaptation by connecting their spiritual power with the devotional power of the masses. Spirituality can be spread not through commodification, but rather through meaningful and conscious relationships intended to benefit the whole.
