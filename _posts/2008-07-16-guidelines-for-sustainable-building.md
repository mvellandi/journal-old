Since a building is also a product &#8211; it comes to stand as an additionally important topic to discuss. These guidelines are adapted from the great book: [Materials, Structures, and Standards by Julia McMorrough](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592531938?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=1592531938 "sustainable building book"). Chapter 16, pgs.132-133.

**1.** Purchase and use materials that are produced as close to the building site as possible, to reduce emissions and energy from shipping, while maximizing a good acquisition cost. Additionally, have materials transported to sites in a just-in-time manner, to reduce potential damage/wear from weather or other circumstances.

**2.** Avoid using any materials that contain <a rel="nofollow" title="wikipedia Chloro fluoro carbon compounds" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFCs#Chloro_fluoro_carbon_compounds_.28CFC.2C_HCFC.29">CFCs (Chloro fluoro carbon compounds)</a>, which are chemical compounds for refrigeration and often used in aerosols. HCFCs are better, but also best avoided. As an alternative to CFCs, they have a shorter atmospheric lifespan delivering therefore less reactive chlorine to the ozone layer.

**3.** Use materials that have a low <a rel="nofollow" title="wikipedia embodied energy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_energy">embodied energy</a>, which is the sum of all energy consumed to produce a product through its early life cycle. Here&#8217;s some materials background information:

&#8211; __LOW:__ Lumber, concrete, fiberglass, and bricks.

&#8211; __MEDIUM/HIGH:__ Ceramics, timber and steel.

&#8211; __VERY HIGH:__ Glass, aluminum, and plastic.

Julia advises that *&#8220;often a higher embodied energy level can be justified if it contributes to lower operating energy, such as when large amounts of thermal mass can significantly reduce heating and cooling needs in well-insulated passive solar buildings.&#8221;*

**4.** Whenever possible, design buildings with <a rel="nofollow" title="wikipedia renewable energy sources" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy">renewable energy sources</a>. These may include <a title="wikipedia passive solar" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_heating">passive solar heating</a>, <a rel="nofollow" title="wikipedia daylighting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylighting">daylighting</a>, and natural cooling.

**5.** Maximize energy efficiency by using high insulation levels and high performance windows.

**6.** Minimize material waste by using standard sizes, and sufficient but not overprotective/superfluous materials use.

**7.** Use recycled or salvaged materials such as heavy timbers, millwork, and electrical & plumbing fixtures whenever possible. If it doesn&#8217;t need to be produced, the better.

**8.** Minimize energy & water consumption through <a rel="nofollow" title="wikipedia daylighting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylighting">daylighting</a> first, [LED lighting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED "wikipedia LED") second, and fluorescent third; Install toilets that use less water and include half-flush buttons.

**9.** Design the landscape to be angled, use well-positioned and appropriate sprinklers, employ tubing for disparately placed plants, and irrigate through:

&#8211; Treated <a title="wikipedia grey water" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_water">gray water</a> water (baths, showers, washers, lavatories)

&#8211; Rain water from collection paths on the building and surrounding area.

**10.** Avoid <a title="wikipedia pvc" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pvc">PVC</a> and other [offgassing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing "wikipedia outgassing") materials and processes with high levels of <a rel="nofollow" title="wikipedia volatile organic compounds" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocs">VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds)</a>, which are highly evaporative carbon-based chemical substances, which contribute to air, soil, and possibly groundwater pollution. They can be found in many paints, stains, caulks, and adhesives.

**11.** Use <a title="wikipedia hydronics" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronic_heating">hydronic heating</a>, which can be used in wall units or through an in-floor heating system that pumps hot water through a thermal mass floor, which absorbs the heat and evenly radiates it over time.
