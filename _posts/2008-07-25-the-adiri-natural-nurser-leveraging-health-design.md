Where there is concern for personal health, and most importantly the health of infants and children, there is a market opportunity.

The <a rel="nofollow" title="adiri natural nurser baby bottle website" href="http://www.adiri.com/">Adiri Natural Nurser</a> is an award winning baby bottle that is <a rel="nofollow" title="bisphenol-a bpa article on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol-A">Bisphenol-A</a> free, and is probably best described in the words of its founders as such:

*&#8220;Designed with the help of doctors, moms and lactation consultants, the AdiriTM Natural NurserTM is the ultimate baby bottle. With reduced air ingestion, unparalleled ease of use, a graceful design and 100% polycarbonate-free materials, the Natural Nurser is a safer, simpler, more natural feeling, bottle feeding experience for your baby, and for you.&#8221;*

Yes, this is indeed a product that has a simple but elegant design. From a product marketing point of view, it is capitalizing on a real & growing societal concern about the relative safety of particular plastics (U.S. #7). And that my friends, is beautiful innovation in practice. The application is for something so highly regarded by parents anywhere in the world: the health of their children.

I would like to use this product as an example of innovation tied to a specific cultural value. Could we use the word &#8216;sustainable&#8216; or &#8216;green&#8216; in this case? Why sure, but by themselves they would be subjective and meaningless. <a rel="nofollow" title="jacquelyn ottman green marketing superstar" href="http://www.greenmarketing.com">Jacquelyn Ottman</a> and other so called &#8216;green marketers&#8216; like myself, will happily tell you that there is no such thing as a &#8216;>green&#8216; product.

__The Point:__ Develop and market better products that provide customers with an improved value proposition, user experience, and benefits conferred, while appealing to relevant values that matter. If it happens to have an ecological advantage over competitive products, so much the better.
