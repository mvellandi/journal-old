A few months ago, I saw a gentleman at an outdoor function who was standing alone and decided to pick up a conversation. Turns out he was the U.S. Brand Manager for Aquafina, the bottled water division of Pepsi. Being that this was a conference about sustainability, he mentioned his feeling of not particularly wanting to be noticed and chastised. I understood his plight but had to laugh a little. After all, this is a touchy subject nowadays with everyone having their own story.

Our discussion came down to the following agreed upon points:

  * Bottled water is convenient and great, but it does need to consumed responsibly. While it is better than soda, drinking it in large numbers is bad for the environment because of the large volume of plastic being produced, often not being recycled at end-of-life.
  * Imported bottled water is now completely unsustainable. It doesn&#8217;t matter if Fiji, Evian, or other companies use carbon offsets or not.
  * Private label bottlers and retail incentives like free cases with $20 purchases, or selling it at a loss to drive additional cross-category sales, is what&#8217;s driving a large portion of the problem.
  * Larger bottles like one liter, are better than smaller ones because the value is better and the likelihood of being shared and reused is greater.

What do **YOU** think?
