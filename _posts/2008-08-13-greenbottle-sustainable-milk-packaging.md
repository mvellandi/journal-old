This milk product packaging produced by [GreenBottle Ltd.](http://greenbottle.com/ "greenbottle recyclable compostable milk packaging United Kingdom"), has been introduced into an [ASDA supermarket](http://www.asda.co.uk/ "ASDA UK supermarket website") this week in Suffolk, United Kingdom. The outer packaging is made from white office waste paper, which can be recycled alongside magazines and newspapers. The inner bag is made from corn starch, and is biodegradable.

ASDA hopes to further distribute these milk bottles over coming six months should customer demand prove viable. The [UK Telegraph newspaper reports](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2534873/Recyclable-cardboard-milk-bottle-hits-supermarket-shelves.html "Telegraph UK article on greenbottle milk packaging recycled paper corn starch biodegradable ASDA supermarket"):

*&#8220;Britons drink around 180 million pints of milk every week, of which around two-thirds is bought in plastic bottles. More than 100,000 tons end up in landfill each year &#8211; equal to 260 jumbo jets. They take 500 years to decompose&#8230;An independent analysis calculated that its overall carbon footprint, including delivery, was 48 per cent lower than the standard plastic bottle.&#8221;*

__NOTE:__ ASDA is owned by Wal-Mart. It should be interesting to note if they take special interest in its American milk producers to produce alternative packaging solutions.
