While LCAs (Life Cycle Assessments) are the means to determine the environmental impact of a product, they can be quite complex. Thus at the beginning of any [product design project](../new-product-design-strategy/ "new product design strategy") (renovative, adaptive, evolutionary, discontinuous), a brand manager or designer has to have a set of guidelines to which they can refer to for concept development. These may coincide with any existing company (or client) policies on materials and labor.

The folks at <a rel="nofollow" title="Lunar Product Design Studios" href="http://www.lunar.com">Lunar Design</a> have put together a document called **<a title="The Designer's Field Guide to Sustainability, by Lunar Design" rel="nofollow" href="http://2094787864708662092-a-1802744773732722657-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/lunarelements/Home/The_Designer%27s_Field_Guide_to_Sustainability_v1.0.pdf?attredirects=0">&#8220;The Designer&#8217;s Field Guide to Sustainability&#8221;</a>**, which asks four practical questions with guidelines for each:

### What is it Trying to Accomplish?

&#8211; Question the premise of the design by considering alternative approaches

&#8211; Make it less complex because simple and elegant designs are often the least impactful

&#8211; Make it more useful; multifunctional products can reduce consumption and increase convenience

### How is it Brought to Life?

&#8211; Reduce material variety, thereby increasing recyclability and decreasing manufacturing energy

&#8211; Avoid toxic/harmful materials and chemicals like PVC, polystyrene, chlorine, lead, and VOCs

&#8211; Reduce size and weight, thus possibly reducing emissions from transport

&#8211; Optimize manufacturing processes by talking to partners on low energy/waste options

&#8211; Design packaging in parallel with products; a must for aligning the brand with total environmental impact

### How is it Used?

&#8211; Design for upgradeability by allowing owners to replace components

&#8211; Create durable and high quality designs that provide long term value; no cheap chic

&#8211; Design for life after death; consider adaptive reuse, offer manufacturer/channel partner return programs

### Where Does it End Up?

&#8211; Make it modular by allowing for easy disassembly, repair, and recycling

&#8211; Maximize recycled, recyclable, renewable, and biodegradable materials

&#8211; Minimize fasteners; they add weight, material variety, and assembly/disassembly complexity

&#8211; Don&#8217;t use paint, especially on plastics because they&#8217;re less likely to be recycled
