From a product design perspective, there will always be useless stuff to many of us. But their production is based on demand. In the last 15 years, we’ve significantly moved to make-to-order systems because the investment in non-committed stock inventory and its eventual markdown, isn’t financially worth it. Demand is based on retailers and consumers. The former has a definite desire to not keep excess inventory, while the latter…well, the world over buys a lot of cheap merchandise that hardly gets used, or is quickly consumed and tossed. The traditional problem from a natural economics perspective is that their true cost to both the environment and society isn&#8217;t being factored in.

Call it the spoils of mass merchandising over decades, that has evolved into a myriad of retail establishments. While the traditional supermarkets, drugstores, and department stores have all experienced significant category expansion, it was the rise of the hypermarkets and discounters that really drove mass consumption to the levels experienced today. Importantly, they&#8217;ve brought increased affluence to millions of people at affordable prices. No one can deny their significance to adolescents and young adults the world over.

So when we think about the volume of purchasing that is both valuable and superfluous, we need to rely on business to provide us with sustainable products first. This implies responsibility on all supply chain partners including originating materials suppliers, manufacturers, designers, brokers, distributors, and retailers. This entails materials data, certifications, and ethical design & sourcing policies for each party that go beyond the law. PVC, polystyrene, and polycarbonates are bad plastics that although aren&#8217;t illegal, should be phased out and replaced with alternatives like polyethylene, biopolymers, and other biomatter. The more we can recycle and reuse these materials, the more you&#8217;re closing the loop. Fair trade and organic is another voluntary field where channel partners have an opportunity to increase sustainable product distribution.

The most important areas for a product developer to spend their time is in removing harmful chemicals, replacing materials and packaging with more sustainable ones, designing for dis-assembly so valuable materials can be collected and repurposed, and lastly building “services”. The last one is a huge toughie because it requires a fundamental shift in business systems, which is FAR beyond the reasonable influence of most any design firm unless they have HUGE clout with the client and can establish a solid business case why it would be better for the user experience, company revenues and expenses, and the environment.
