In this gem of an interview I found with investigative journalist Mark Shapiro, he talks about a variety of important issues related to sustainable products, toxicity, regulation, and how the European Union (the largest collective economic entity) is leading the world in environmental/social regulation. So much so that developing countries like India and China are sending delegates to Brussels to learn how to adopt similar progressive programs in their countries.

The potential implication is that America&#8217;s lagging governmental regulation on toxic substances, will leave us with more dangerous products, relative to other countries. My brief summary doesn&#8217;t suffice compared to the vast amount of stories and insight listening to the whole interview will give you.
