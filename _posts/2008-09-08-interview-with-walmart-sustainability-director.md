Janelle Kearsley gives us an interesting look inside how Wal-Mart is building sustainability into its culture through educating buyers, and establishing networks with diverse 3rd party collaborators. Additionally, they&#8217;re building energy,water, and waste reduction thinking throughout its operations, supplemented by employee responsibility for proactively starting small initiatives whose best practices can then be shared with the org at large.

While I highly commend them for their multi-party collaborations for product development, and their bottoms-up approach to sustainability initiatives, I am concerned about the number of products that will receive 3rd party certifications. Consumers must have a sense of trust in the sustainability of the products they buy. Granted, packaging minimizations and other product design aspects (like removing water) speak for themselves. And as for [the product concepts for Spring 09](../wal-mart-and-green-product-marketing-for-2009/ "Walmart green product marketing plan"), stories are good but what about quality assurance? Should consumers trust what the marketing copy says? If we&#8217;re not including at least some credible single-attribute product certifications (ex: FSC, Energy Star, TransFair, RainForest Alliance), you&#8217;re opening the door for potential greenwashing.

For product sustainability, the absolute two best things Wal-Mart can begin doing now is PUSH manufacturers toward 100% post consumer recycled paper fibers and PET (polyethylene) plastics.
