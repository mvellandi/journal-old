This video by <a rel="nofollow" title="basel action network website" href="http://www.ban.org/">Basel Action Network</a>, describes computer waste being shipped to and discarded in Africa is a sure sign of the urgent need for closed-loop recycling. Can you imagine this happening in within your area? To allow some developing country to take care of this product and systems design problem that bears significant ecological and air polluting effects, is simply unethical.
