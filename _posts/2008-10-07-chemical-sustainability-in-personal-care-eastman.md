Personal care and cosmetics products have long been criticized for the toxicity of certain ingredients. The naturals category, as large as that is, has thrived precisely for the reason that they could point out their ingredients with pride and tell marketing stories. So with the current era of transparency dawning upon us, and a consumer market segment of around 20% willing to buy, manufacturers everywhere are looking toward green chemistry and naturally-sourced derivatives for this growing category in health, beauty, and personal care.

Jim McCaulley of <a title="eastman chemical company website" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eastman.com/">Eastman Chemical</a> shares some insights on this trend, and notes also that manufacturers are going to have to be more honest about specific product claims and their effectiveness.
