### **Speakers**

Priya Haji &#8211; CEO & Co-founder, [World of Good, Inc.](http://www.worldofgoodinc.com/)

Robert Chatwani &#8211; General Manager of [WorldofGood.com](http://worldofgood.ebay.com/), eBay, Inc.

### __Summary__

Two socially conscious visionaries have figured out a way to leverage the strengths of two very different brands to create the worldâ€™s largest online marketplace of people- and planet-positive products to engage people in compassionate commerce. Robert Chatwani and Priya Haji discuss their creative business model, how WorldofGood.com got its name, how people can connect more directly to the producers and cultures where unique products are made, and how these vastly different organizations are working so closely together to make commerce a force for good.

### **Review**

What I particularly like is the design of the website with its earthy feel, the stories of the producers, and how the items meet certain performance criteria. Additionally, proceeds from sales go into further supporting the artisans and social/economic development programs. I truly wish them much luck. There have been a variety of online stores that distribute foreign products, but the credibility of the importers must be questioned. A big part of the experience in buying these products is KNOWING that they&#8217;re fairly unique (not being mass produced in a Chinese factory for customers worldwide) and that your purchase is positively contributing to someone&#8217;s welfare (without all the middlemen continuously taking cuts).

Having been to their last event in June I must say that the speakers, topics, and experience is above any other I&#8217;ve been to. See their schedule to get an idea what you&#8217;d be in for.
