Françoise Serralta is seen here speaking at the &#8220;Digging Deeper&#8221; Event hosted by the IDSA in SF last summer (graciously <a rel="nofollow" href="http://iconocast.typepad.com/iconocast/2008/11/francoise-serralta-on-sustainable-design.html">captured for us</a> by the folks at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lunar.com/">Lunar Design</a>). She is the strategic research and planning director with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.peclersparis.com/">PeclersParis</a>.

Finished with ideologies and utopian warrior visions on ecology and a perfect world, Françoise is preaching one thing:

### **Pragmatism**

In her presentation she gives us five main messages on sustainability:

  1. Shift from negative to positive semantics in our vocabulary
  2. Bioperformance -Applying renewable, natural, and biomimicked processes to our consumer world
  3. Pared-down and simplified design
  4. Collaborative design for local solutions
  5. Assistive design to make sustainable solutions easy to adopt.
