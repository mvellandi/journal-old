### **Speaker**:

Mark Lee &#8211; CEO, [SustainAbility](http://www.sustainability.com/)

### __Summary__:

The history and future of future of sustainability is illustrated through waves, as Mark Lee explains in this presentation. He first looks at the last four decades highlighting the public&#8217;s concerns, business community&#8217;s reactions, and the role of governance and regulation. Then Mark addresses a few of the largest sustainability issues other than climate change, and gives us some models for systemic change.

### __Review__:

Mark does a great job in describing how we got where we are today, and what social values and environmental concerns were the driving current in each series of waves. What I found particularly interesting was his mentioning that climate change as the dominating topic among many conferences he&#8217;d been to lately, was overshadowing other important concerns and divides (between rich and underdeveloped countries). By looking at the ten divides at the 11:50 marker in the video, you can quickly imagine all the different NGOs and individuals working across the sustainability spectrum.
