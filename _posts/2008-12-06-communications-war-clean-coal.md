With the growing social concern about global warming, major attention has been paid to two areas: fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. In the U.S., the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.americaspower.org/">American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity</a> is a coal industry group formed by merging the <a title="Americans for Balanced Energy Choices" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Americans_for_Balanced_Energy_Choices">Americans for Balanced Energy Choices</a> (ABEC) and the <a rel="nofollow" title="Center for Energy and Economic Development" href="http://www.cleancoalusa.org/">Center for Energy and Economic Development</a> (CEED). For the last 18 months, they&#8217;ve launched a series of television advertisements touting the benefits of clean coal in order to protect & promote the coal industry&#8217;s public image. While they have various ads you can probably find online, here&#8217;s one that is highlighted on the group&#8217;s website:

In my opinion, this is a poor ad to showcase because the message is quite defensive of coal as an energy source, and employs fear that our American standard of living would be diminished should coal&#8217;s usage be reduced. If the industry is serious, it needs to be substantive and design ads and multimedia that educate the public. I will give them credit for having a blog titled <a rel="nofollow" href="http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/">Behind the Plug</a>, and talking in an open way.

On the flip side of the fence lie a diverse group of environmental advocates who have been denouncing clean coal as a myth. Just Google the term and you&#8217;ll numerous articles on how the technologies and processes (ex: carbon capture and sequestration), are 10-15 years away from any viable implementation. Thus, the industry&#8217;s promotion amounts to greenwashing.

Recently these detractors formed <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thisisreality.org/">The Reality Coalition</a>, as a project of the <a rel="nofollow" title="Alliance for Climate Protection" href="http://www.climateprotect.org/">Alliance for Climate Protection</a>, <a title="Sierra Club" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sierraclub.org/">Sierra Club</a>, <a rel="nofollow" title="National Wildlife Federation" href="http://www.nwf.org/">National Wildlife Federation</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" title="Natural Resourses Defense Council" href="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" title="League of Conservation Voters" href="http://www.lcv.org/">League of Conservation Voters</a>. The following is the television ad they recently put out:

My personal inclination is to side with the critics because I see an importance to be truthful to the American public and particularly politicians. With this particular issue, the battlelines have now been firmly drawn by both sides and I hope to see a great debate going on. Joe Lucas, the Communications Director for America&#8217;s Power, has already begun with this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2008/12/were-accused-of-being-misleading-name-one-incident-were-still-waiting.html">blog post refuting Reality&#8217;s ad campaign</a>.
