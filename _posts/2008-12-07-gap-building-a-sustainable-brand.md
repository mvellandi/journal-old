### __Summary__:

Over the past decade-plus, Gap Inc. has demonstrated a commitment to ethical sourcing and improving conditions in the factories in which its products are made. Leveraging this foundation, Gap Inc. is working to further integrate social responsibility and environmental objectives into its Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy brands. More than simply strengthening its programs and finding better ways to do business, the brands are finding new ways to connect with customers and involve them in their journey. In this featured presentation, representatives from various parts of the business – including Social Responsibility, Strategy and one of Gap Inc.&#8217;s brands – present a fresh case study on how the internal pieces are coming together to create a fresh, authentic story for customers in 2008.

### __Review__**:**

 ****There&#8217;s a lot to cover on sustainability and a manufacturer/retailer, and given only 40 min. to speak, I understand that one can&#8217;t cover many details. Kindley and her team gave a pretty good presentation; the impression left is that while they do care and probably do have some substantive actions and policies in place, we can&#8217;t really know for sure how far they&#8217;re pushing the ball forward unless we were to dig into their social responsibility reports. [Their official website](http://www.gapinc.com/public/SocialResponsibility/socialres.shtml) gives us some insight into the areas involved, but you&#8217;ll notice that their latest published report is from 2005-06. Um, what happened to the last two years? Not to be mean or anything, but I think GAP can do a little better. I&#8217;d also like to know if they&#8217;ve incorporated the [Global Reporting Initiative](http://www.globalreporting.org) and if they have any [ISO 14000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_14000) certifications. It&#8217;s not like having these two things under your belt would imply you&#8217;re performing well, just that an established credible framework for monitoring and reporting is in place.
