Ted is seen here speaking at the &#8220;Digging Deeper&#8221; Event hosted by the IDSA in SF last summer (graciously <a rel="nofollow" href="http://iconocast.typepad.com/iconocast/2008/11/ted-howes-on-sustainable-design.html">captured for us</a> by the folks at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lunar.com/">Lunar Design</a>). Here are some of the highlights of the presentation.

Sustainability is something we&#8217;re far from. At <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ideo.com">IDEO</a> (Ted&#8217;s employer), they&#8217;ve gone ahead to think much more about environmental impacts in the products they design. All product designers are now at a crossroads of business and sustainability; it&#8217;s about both thinking about materialization and dematerialization. Life cycle impacts throughout the product&#8217;s supply chain and usage are becoming fairly common now, technical and complex as they may be. Some specific advice is to understand these impacts, engage experts early and often, and build fast but revisit the project.
