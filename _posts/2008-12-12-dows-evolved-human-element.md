In recent months, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dow.com">Dow</a> and its agency <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bbdo.com">BBDO</a> have expanded their <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dow.com/Hu/">Human Element campaign online</a> by adding two documentaries to its website. To make them &#8220;share friendly&#8221;, each has the option for direct linking, embedding, and downloading. The universal message is, in my words expressed, _&#8220;We care about the world and we&#8217;re building solutions to address problems that are arising.&#8221;_ Regardless of what we may personally think about Dow, there&#8217;s something to be admired about how they&#8217;re communicating with us. Their campaign has evolved from glossy, emotional television advertisements to mini-documentaries that delve deeper into a specific topic. To further elaborate on that topic, the website includes a &#8220;More Resources&#8221; screen, available as a button and as page following each clip, where more info is given in addition to related links, video interviews, mini-slideshows.

Perhaps their communications will further evolve into making a multimedia library on how they&#8217;re addressing specific sustainability issues. While yes, this represents the creative work of BBDO, in the end we must assess if an ongoing campaign is effective, by asking if the stories come across as authentic. Personally, there&#8217;s nothing more credible than seeing a company representative personally speak on the matter, but I know 40min video presentations aren&#8217;t sexy or viable for mass distribution &#8211; unless you use social media like I did for a renowned niche media company, helping a bit of depth to Dow&#8217;s story ([see the presentation here](../dows-human-element-campaign/)).

I would have liked to embed the videos here in this post, but there&#8217;s one **MAJOR** problem: they automatically start playing.

Folks, taking over people&#8217;s speakers without their permission is a big no no. If a video is placed on a dedicated html page or javascript window, where someone clicks through to see it, then that&#8217;s okay because it&#8217;s likely remaining only on the publisher&#8217;s website. But if you&#8217;re allowing for a video to be distributed through social media, then there is no way to control the user experience. And if such a video autoplays, there&#8217;s a good chance that it won&#8217;t conform to syndicators&#8217; desired user experience, and will thus have to be either dropped or designed around. Just a friendly tip ðŸ™‚
