Ernst Ligteringen, CEO of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.globalreporting.org/">Global Reporting Initiative</a> (GRI), speaks in this interview with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/">ClimateActionProgramme</a> about the role of climate change reporting within the GRI. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/"></a>

Interesting to note is Ernst&#8217;s answer to the question,

**&#8220;What are the next steps on reporting climate change mitigation?&#8221;**

_&#8220;I think there is still so much to be found out, really, on what are the full dimensions of climate change. There&#8217;s a lot of speculation and we will be finding out more. Science will further advance in this area, so that&#8217;s where we would get the indicators on what is possible. The GRI and what we&#8217;re doing is following this debate, but all the time being the platform where interested parties from business, the investment world, civil society, regulators, from all sides can come together to have this discussion, about with all these developments and all of this complexity &#8211; what are the core, meaningful indicators which would help us understand one another when we are talking about impacts and about results?&#8221;_
