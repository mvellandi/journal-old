Awesome explanation of climate change through this animation by Leo Murray. You can <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.triplepundit.com/pages/in-this-age-of-sustainability.php">also read the interview with Leo</a>, conducted by [Gennefer Snowfield](http://www.acclimedia.com/) who pointed this out to me.
