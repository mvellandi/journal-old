I wish I could take credit for this interactive infographic, but alas I found it <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/interactive/2008/dec/09/climatechange-carbonemissions">on the Guardian website</a> and embedded it here for you to check out (because some things are worth more than a mere link). This map shows global carbon emissions data for 2006, which totaled 29,195m tonnes – up 2.4% on 2005.
