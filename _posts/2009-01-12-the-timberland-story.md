<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.timberland.com">Timberland</a> is a boot manufacturer that espouses the right kind of social and environmental responsibility: substantive and transparent. Their brand isn&#8217;t explicitly known to be *green*. They make comfortable and high-quality boots (among other merchandise) for men, women, and kids in traditional and fashionable styles. I&#8217;d like to cover more about them in a future post, but I figured this [video interview](../the-timberland-story/) with their President & CEO Jeffrey Swartz would provide you a good glimpse for now.
