<img class="size-medium wp-image-758 alignleft" style="margin:5px 20px 10px 0; float: left;" title="clorox_green_works_wipes" src="../wp-content/uploads/2009/01/clorox_green_works_wipes-117x300.jpg" alt="clorox green works wipes" width="117" height="300" />Green Works from Clorox launched a new product this Monday, following its one year anniversary. Its <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.greenworkspresskit.com/January_12_2009.html">Natural Biodegradable Cleaning Wipes</a> are said to be made from 100% cellulose fibers, derived from renewable farm grown trees, and are supposed to be biodegradable in typical compost conditions. What &#8216;typical&#8217; means is hopefully, for Clorox&#8217;s and the public&#8217;s perception, a backyard or home composting environment. (Aside, &#8216;biodegradable&#8217; is in marketing terms according to the FTC Green Guides, a subjective term that should be backed up by evidence).

The wipes will be on shelves soon, and are available starting in Original scent with SRPs of $3.39 (30-count canister) and for a $5.99 (62-count canister). This is competitively priced compared to other wipes from Clorox brand, Reckitt Benckiser&#8217;s Lysol, and P&G&#8217;s Mr. Clean.

I only see good tidings for Green Works, as they&#8217;re best positioned to sweep up consumer demand due to a maturing brand equity following much shelf space from retailers, and a great price point from their economies of scale.

While yes it does compete against Clorox&#8217;s own brand, I see both products targeting different audience segments. Clorox&#8217;s strong brand affiliation with bleach resonates strongly with customers seeking comfort in clean to ultra (obsessive compulsive) clean. Green Works on the other hand resonates more with the conscious shopper who likes clean and a degree of safety from unknown harm from &#8216;harsh chemicals&#8217;. Okay, I&#8217;ll add the truly green-minded shoppers too, although in numbers based on actual purchasing behavior they&#8217;re quite small a segment. If we consider the economic times and more wallet conservative, the entire brand should do well since folks are getting the best of both worlds. Now if only they&#8217;ll add more scents this year &#8211; I&#8217;m an orange loving guy myself 🙂
