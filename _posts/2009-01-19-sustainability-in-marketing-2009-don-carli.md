Like you haven&#8217;t heard me enough on this issue, today I bring you some sage thinking from Don Carli with the [Institute for Sustainable Communications](http://www.sustainablecommunication.org/). I&#8217;ve spoken with Don in the past and must say after 10min I felt like down-on-knees-arms-praising him, saying _&#8220;We&#8217;re not worthy!&#8221;_. I think of communications in terms of writing and design. Don on the other hand thinks of the medium, the energy consumed and the materials that went into making it, and its end of life. In this interview with AdAge, Don talks about what the new year holds for the confluence of sustainability and marketing in terms of strategy.
