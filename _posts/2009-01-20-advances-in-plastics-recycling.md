Plastics are a favorite material of mine that I&#8217;ve learned to love and dislike. Just because they come from petroleum doesn&#8217;t matter to me that much; in so many ways they&#8217;ve been a miracle for mankind. It&#8217;s just the waste that bothers me, particularly in the ocean.

Until one year ago, I thought that all plastics thrown into the recycling bin would be happily saved from a landfilled destiny. But through conversations and online articles, I came to learn that PET (polyethylene terephthalate #1) was the likeliest candidate to be sorted out simply because they&#8217;re often used for bottles. HDPE (#2), LDPE (#4), and polypropylene (#5) had medium chances; and polystyrene (#6), polyvinyl chloride (#3), and polycarbonates (#7) had the lowest chances &#8211; btw, these last three are bad and if you want to know why, ask me in the comments.

Alas though, technology has been improving in sorting out various plastics. While I&#8217;m not familiar with how good <a rel="nofollow" href="http://recyclebank.com/">RecycleBank</a> is at it, given their business model I&#8217;d assume they&#8217;d want to maximize their volume of plastic waste collected-to-sold ratio. Interestingly though, I found <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkMngS_MO3w">this video from a plastics conference</a> that enlightened me to innovative techniques in the coming years.

Now to be honest, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds for bioplastics which are a very mixed bag in themselves. Human behavior would suggest for one that if it doesn&#8217;t look like wood or leaves, it&#8217;ll go into the mixed waste or recyclables bin. Since there&#8217;s no official classification for bioplastics, they&#8217;re most likely to be landfilled or perhaps incinerated. The first scenario isn&#8217;t necessarily bad since it will supposedly degrade over time, but it&#8217;s still a cradle-to-grave scenario (which eco-philosophists care to avoid). The incineration option though, along with other municipal solid waste, could provide fuel for power plants.

In any case, the future is getting brighter.
