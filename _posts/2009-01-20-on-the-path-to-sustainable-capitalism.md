[Video Begin &#8211; 7:30] Can capitalism as a system be truly sustainable and just? From global climate change and resource depletion to widening inequality and social unrest, current economic and political models are proving unsustainable. Yet businesses, social entrepreneurs, NGOs and governments are collaborating like never before to address these problems. Can these solutions scale? This interdisciplinary seminar series from the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley will examine the changes necessary within the free market system — including law and public policy, consumer behavior, science and technology, the design of products and cities, and faith — for a fundamental shift towards a truly sustainable future.
