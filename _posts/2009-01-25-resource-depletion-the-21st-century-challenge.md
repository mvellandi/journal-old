Today I bring you an excellent lecture that looks at sustainability within a world macromeconomic perspective. Quoting from the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni2dv1inQR4">official description</a>: _&#8220;Award-winning author Richard Heinberg (The Oil Depletion Protocol; Peak Everything) identifies the essential axioms of sustainability and ties them to current economic trends such as the high and volatile prices of oil and other commodities. Species survival will require more than &#8220;Sustainability Lite&#8221;a vague commitment to more environmentally benign practices, but instead an all-encompassing effort to live within the ultimate resource limits of the planet.&#8221;_
