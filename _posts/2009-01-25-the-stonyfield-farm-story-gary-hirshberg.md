Another superstar brand in the green/good business field is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.stonyfield.com/">Stonyfield Farm</a>, a yogurt manufacturer in New Hampshire. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonyfield_Farm">According to Wikipedia</a>, they started out as an organic farming school in 1983 and today is the number one organic yogurt brand, and third overall in the U.S. Its Profits for the Planet program gives 10% of profits to environmental causes.

Gary Hirshberg is their CEO who last year wrote the book &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Stirring-Up-Make-Money-World/dp/1401303447/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232905219&sr=8-1">How to Make Money and Save the World</a>&#8220;. In this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://fora.tv/2008/02/20/How_to_Make_Money_and_Save_the_World">video from Fora.tv</a>, Gary talks on a variety of awesome subjects. Unfortunately, Fora only gives embeds the first 25 min, so you might want to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://fora.tv/2008/02/20/How_to_Make_Money_and_Save_the_World">check out the entire program</a> &#8211; which is cool by the way since the chapter links move the playhead right to the marker.
