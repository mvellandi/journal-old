With the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.usgbc.org/">US Green Building Council</a> celebrating its 15th anniversary recently, they&#8217;ve put together this video and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://communicate.usgbc.org/2008/">interactive flash timeline of their accomplishments to date in an annual report</a> of sorts. I&#8217;m quite happy for them. Originally these videos were all <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZPuTNLf5yc">broken up on YouTube</a> since they (YouTube) implemented their 10min length limit rule&#8230;so I happily compiled them all together into one and removed the top borders (so us fans can more easily share). Enjoy!
