Put together by <a rel="nofollow" title="Scamper Branding website" href="http://www.scamperbranding.com/">Scamper Branding</a> in the UK, this is one of the best explanations of sustainability&#8217;s role in branding, business, and society. Concise, clear, rational and better than I can say it myself in 7min. Enjoy!
