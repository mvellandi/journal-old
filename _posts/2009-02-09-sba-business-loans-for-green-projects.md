I&#8217;ve always thought that to provide additional incentives for investing in projects which reduce power or provide some other green-related benefit, there has to be some kind of financial carrot in the form of special loans or lower interest rates. The best organization that could make a difference on such a massive scale would be the [U.S. Small Business Administration](http://www.sba.gov/ "sba website").

To our delight, <a rel="nofollow" title="sba green loans press release" href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/loan/prweb1961764.htm">this press release</a> describes the expanded <a rel="nofollow" title="SBA 504 Loan Program" href="http://www.nadco.org/">SBA 504 Loan Program</a> which provides incentives for businesses to go green. These programs typically require only a 10% down payment, a Certified Development Company (CDC)  handles up to 40% of the project costs, and finally a lender supplies the final 50%. Normally an SBA 504 loan goes up to $1.5 million, but since the passage of the <a rel="nofollow" title="govtrack link to energy bill" href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6">2007 Energy Independence and Security Act</a> by Congress, the total amount loaned was expanded under 3 program changes.

  * Purchasing, constructing, or retrofitting facilities with energy saving technologies which result in a 10% consumption decrease, allows for up to a $4 million loan (up to $9 million if the <a rel="nofollow" title="public policy goal information" href="http://www.nadco.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3326">new public policy goal</a> applies). This may entail improved insulation, lighting, HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning), and energy efficient windows among other options.
  * Renewable energy generation (ex: solar, biomass, hydropower, ocean thermal, geothermal and wind) projects are covered up to $4 million.
  * Sustainable facility design projects as deemed eligible under <a rel="nofollow" title="website for LEED" href="http://www.usgbc.org/">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</a> standards and the [Green Building Certificate Institute](http://www.gbci.org/ "gbci website"). Up to $2 million is available by working with qualified architects and engineers.

Neat huh? I&#8217;m hoping the major newspapers and other publications pick up on this story. Please <a rel="nofollow" title="sba green loans press release" href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/loan/prweb1961764.htm">share the release with others</a> you believe might benefit from the program.
