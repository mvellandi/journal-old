After reading this <a rel="nofollow" title="clorox ingredient communications press release" href="http://www.csrwire.com/News/14541">press release</a> by Clorox saying they&#8217;ve expanded their product ingredient communications because they&#8217;re committed to health and safety, it made me wonder what the other big powerhouse consumer product giants do in this regard. If you know me, chemical and food safety is a darling subject of mine. Now, all I did was spend a max of 10 minutes time browsing their websites. A big principle in web communications design is usability for both general and specific visitor profiles; thus, people who are interested in particular topics shouldn&#8217;t have to browse around your site endlessly.

Here&#8217;s how some of the major companies measured up in my quick analysis:

  * <a rel="nofollow" title="clorox website" href="http://www.thecloroxcompany.com/">__Clorox__</a> &#8211; Both material safety data sheets (msds) and product ingredient listings are one click from drop down menu on homepage, under &#8220;Products&#8221;.
  * <a rel="nofollow" title="proctor and gamble website" href="http://www.pg.com/">__Proctor & Gamble__</a> &#8211; Product safety page three clicks from homepage; &#8220;Company -> Our Commitment -> Product Safety&#8221;. Includes further links to msds, and specialty pages on various topics.
  * <a rel="nofollow" title="colgate palmolive website" href="http://www.colgate.com/">__Colgate Palmolive__</a> &#8211; No information found.
  * <a rel="nofollow" title="reckitt benckiser website" href="http://www.reckittbenckiser.com">__Reckitt Benckiser__</a> &#8211; No information found. (Aside: please disable audio auto-playing corporate video)
  * <a rel="nofollow" title="sc johnson website" href="http://scjohnson.com/">__SC Johnson__</a> &#8211; Msds available 2 clicks from homepage; &#8220;Products -> MSDS&#8221;. See also: [Whatsinsidescjohnson.com](http://www.whatsinsidescjohnson.com/)
  * <a rel="nofollow" title="unilever global website" href="http://www.unilever.com">__Unilever__</a> &#8211; &#8220;What&#8217;s In Our Products&#8221; with one click from homepage (bottom), shows ingredient info for European brands only (select country to view). [Unilever USA website](http://www.unileverusa.com "unilever usa website") though doesn&#8217;t appear to have any information.
  * <a rel="nofollow" title="henkel website" href="http://www.henkel.com">__Henkel__</a> &#8211; No specific product ingredient info found, although sustainable commitment, progress, and other data is available with 2 clicks from homepage; &#8220;Sustainability -> Sustainable Products&#8221;.

So overall, Clorox does perform the best in terms of quick and easy info access. {Update 3/12/09 &#8211; SC Johnson launched <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.whatsinsidescjohnson.com/">WhatsinsideSCJohnson.com</a> , so they may now be #1}. Unilever comes in second, although specific info is only available for European brands. P&G and SC Johnson at least gave us the msds, although these are meant as handling and storage guidelines to comply with OSHA regulation. Henkel does a fair job in being focused around the sustainability and health topic, but doesn&#8217;t provide us with detailed specifics. Colgate and Reckitt need to provide us with something (get with the program people! )

There are folks that care about this information and they&#8217;re not just in the &#8220;green consumer demographic&#8221;. Smaller manufacturers are priding themselves on being safe, healthy, and sometimes pushing the marketing envelope of &#8220;transparency&#8221;. It&#8217;s in the public&#8217;s interest to have this kind of information readily available not because you&#8217;re therefore going to be light green, but rather because it&#8217;s socially responsible.
