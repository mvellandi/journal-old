Ronni brings up some excellent points here on corporate social responsibility which I&#8217;d never considered before.

### Does Being Good Translate Into Improved Performance?

The popular belief is Yes, however the academic circles are unsure. What kind of performance are we talking about? If it&#8217;s regarding product/service quality, or the operational support functions within a company, then perhaps so. But what about financially? Revenue is based on sales, and profitability is based on revenue minus expenses. Then there are other factors like [Porter&#8217;s five forces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_five_forces_analysis "wikipedia article on porter's five forces analysis") affecting competitivenessÂ which impacts long-term performance. So in overall assessments, it may be difficult to determine if and how much social responsibility activities affect the bottom line.

As Ronni says in evaluating performance, _&#8220;it&#8217;s difficult to know whether the companies that spend on social initiatives are just the ones with the most money to begin with, or the ones with the biggest marketing departments to promote their efforts.&#8221;_

### Evaluating CSR with Metrics

There are just too many metrics to consider, Ronni adds. Which ones are meaningful for categories like giving, volunteerism, and environmental activities? As an example, he cites awards received by a company.

  * Who gave the award?
  * How many other companies competed for it, or were considered?
  * Does the award signify a meaningful accomplishment?

### Two Goals For Improving CSR Measurement

  1. Reduce the number of metrics and decide which are the most valuable for each classification such as diversity, community relations, and environmental performance. This allows for people to make interpretations of metrics and reasoned assessments easier.
  2. Allow for greater user control in how they want to use the metrics. Weighted scoring mechanisms would help people to make selections or judgements based on the values that are important for them (Ex: socially responsible mutual fund analysis).

As an aside, did yoll notice how JOLLY Ronni is with his big smile and excited demeanor? Just one of the other great things I liked about this video in making it stand out among other, and brightening my day too ðŸ™‚
