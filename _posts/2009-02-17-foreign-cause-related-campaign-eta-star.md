Awesome creative ad co-produced by ETA Star, a property development company in Dubai, and Red Crescent Authority in the United Arab Emirates to help in building homes for the homeless during last year&#8217;s holy month of Ramadan. The cause related campaign titled &#8220;Homes for the Homeless&#8221; donated 1% of total sales, and works with a regional chapter of Habitat for Humanity.

As I shared this on Twitter with my pal [Arun](http://twitter.com/arun4) in Oman, he summed it up quite nicely: _&#8220;Local content / execution, but global meaning / message. A great piece of work.&#8221;_
