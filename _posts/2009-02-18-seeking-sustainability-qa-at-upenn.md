Great video Q&A discussion on a host of sustainability subjects, hosted by the University of Pennsylvania last month at their Founder&#8217;s Day Symposium. I unfortunately don&#8217;t have any other info on the speakers and variety of subjects (since I have yet to watch the entirety myself) &#8211; but I do know it was quite intelligent, and that is always attractive to me 🙂
