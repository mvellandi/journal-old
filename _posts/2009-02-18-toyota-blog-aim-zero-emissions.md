Not exactly breaking news, but Toyota Europe <a rel="nofollow" title="totyota zero emissions blog" href="http://www.aimzeroemissions.eu/green-design/">launched a blog</a> last month to &#8220;converse&#8221; with the public on its sustainability initiatives among other topics. I use the word converse, because in this case Toyota did the right thing in bringing a human voice to the blog, as you can read from this excerpt from the first posting last month:

*Welcome to our new blog. My name is Colin Hensley and I am responsible for Corporate Affairs and Planning at Toyota Motor Europe. I’ll be posting here regularly from now. I’ve been a great believer in the internet for a long time, and I am very excited that we’ll finally be able to share our thoughts with you here and keep you up to date with what’s happening at Toyota in Europe. I’m especially keen to share with you our environmental initiatives, and our commitment to local society.*

*It will take a bit of time to get this ‘right’, but please bear with me. Based on your feedback I’ll try to apply kaizen (or continuous improvement) and write about the things you would like to know about&#8230;*

I truly dig the effort put out here and while they don&#8217;t have many comments now, their presence here is well noted by me. It&#8217;s my belief that any firm whose operations and customers&#8217; product use have an social/health/environmental impact, will eventually have some kind of blog up and running; at least for the purpose of public relations, if not public interaction with value-minded citizens, journalists, and others.
