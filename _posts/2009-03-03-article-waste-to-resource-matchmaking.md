*&#8220;Spanish ceramics and bathroom manufacturer Porcelanosa has found an outlet for its used polystyrene through materials &#8220;dating service&#8221; the <a href="http://www.nisp.org.uk/">National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP)</a>.&#8221;*

Awesome short story of how a unique organization can help turn one person&#8217;s waste into a resource input for another. This particular example is great because polystyrene (in addition to PVC and polycarbonates), are seldom recycled. I figure that even if the production of a polymer produces toxic byproducts or can be harmful, it&#8217;s better to use post-industrial/consumer materials than virgin ones. At least we&#8217;re tackling the 3R&#8217;s, repurposing, and avoiding a landfilled end-of-life. Now imagine what we could do on a larger scale. Please [California DTSC](http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/), implement some kind of similar exchange in our state and further be a model for our nation.
