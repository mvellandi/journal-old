One of my favorite topics is materials science, so naturally a story about car seat biofoam made from soybeans would be cool. What I like particularly about this video is its production. It&#8217;s not a brand talking, but rather a Ford employee telling a story, which is more humanistic and appealing. I find this a great example of how brands should be communicating their social and environmental responsibility these days; using storytelling around specific subjects.

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0EJWSXyEtY">Here&#8217;s an example of how NOT to go about telling your story</a>. By traditional standards, the video is pretty well done. I&#8217;m a bit more critical though, and here&#8217;s why. The company had put together an 8 minute corporate presentation (not a story), that tries to cover a variety of topics in a short amount of time. You might notice that the employees sound like they&#8217;re reading from a script, and sound more like they&#8217;re selling you tires or hardware than talking with you. In all, I learned about their employee diversity than anything else.

**TIP:** Keep your sustainability communications simple, credible, short (at least in video), concrete, emotional, and employ stories.
