Interesting microsite from Toyota that acts as a communications tool for virtual social and environmental responsibility activities. These include safety, water, land, air, community, and energy.

While communications is the indirect benefit, the campaign seeks innovation ideas on these six areas from website visitors who create a profile. This is part of a contest that runs until March 31st, 2009. The grand prize winner for the &#8220;Why Not&#8221; Innovation Experience gets a VIP factory tour, the opportunity to meet &#8216;top innovators&#8217; in New York City, and accommodations. Other submissions may be considered for smaller rewards.

While I really like the interactive design, I do know this is a limited-time campaign and contest, which kind of draws me away.
