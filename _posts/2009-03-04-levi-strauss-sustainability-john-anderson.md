  * Their history of coming to work with contractors and establishing company sourcing guidelines
  * Linking sustainability and productivity initiatives together
  * The rising social awareness and value for ethical business and trade
  * Water quality, usage, and efficiency
  * How emerging countries will have a huge impact on the world&#8217;s resources and how it&#8217;s our responsibility and opportunity to help them along the way by teaching best practices, and avoiding the mistakes developed nations had made
  * The need to work with multiple parties in this day and age, including NGOs, competitors, and others in helping to make a better future
