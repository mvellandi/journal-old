Yes, that was an intentional play on words in my post title. Because here&#8217;s the thing: Any kind of eco-certification, whether it be single or multi-attribute, costs money. When you&#8217;re in the higher leagues, examining a variety of environmental and social health aspects, it can be pretty expensive depending on who the certifying body is, and how their process works.

If the criteria are open and transparent, it means more people are capable of learning and applying them within their company, or for others. But if the process is proprietary and walled up, it means only specialized consultants who dive deep into partnership with the certifying body can apply the methodology. In one way, you could think of it like Microsoft versus Linux.

Now don&#8217;t get me wrong; I like to see more credibly certified products out there. It&#8217;s just that the larger engineering, design, and business communities don&#8217;t want to, nor have time for getting deep into an expensive, bureaucratic process of getting cradle to cradle certified. Period. Although the following isn&#8217;t a certification program, the [Okala framework](http://www.sustainableminds.com/okala) was established by some brilliant folks in conjunction with the Industrial Designers Society of America. That is, to teach a process for sustainable product design to students and practitioners.

If someone wants to pursue Cradle to Cradle certification, please go for it! Just know that you read (from at least what I believe to be), a good version of the truth. I may be holding a bit of a cynical edge in writing this; it was primarily a reaction to the headline verb &#8216;earns&#8217;.

[SMaRT](http://mts.sustainableproducts.com/) &#8211; Wherefore art thou? Was it the downturn in the economy? Marketing not good enough? I don&#8217;t know. From what I deeply learned, you are very credible, have an open methodology that is ANSI certified, cover more bases than C2C, you&#8217;re consensus based, and cheaper too.

To wrap this up now, I will close on the observation that big Goliath certification architectures [proprietary (C2C), open (SMaRT)], aren&#8217;t very attractive to begin with. Smaller single-attribute, category specific ([EcoLogo](http://www.ecologo.org/en/)), and trade industry-established certifications are just easier and seemingly more relevant. Progressively, we&#8217;ll see more of these types of product certifications pursued by companies.

Shoppers won&#8217;t care. Sure, the concept of having them be able to put trust in an overarching and credible scorecard-based certification eco-label would be dandy. But it isn&#8217;t going to happen. While buildings can become LEED certified (also a multi-attribute scorecard methodology), most all people understand the concept of a building. But what if you substitute that mental construct of a noun, with the highly subjective word &#8220;product&#8221;? Houston, we have a problem here. A shirt is not a chocolate bar, nor is a chair a laptop computer.

Do you see where I&#8217;m going with this? Hence my prediction on how certifications will be taken up by companies. In my mind, the average person would like to know that what they&#8217;re buying is safe, is relatively benign on the environment, and doesn&#8217;t contribute to social inequity. Just throw all the data in the CSR report so the greenies can check it out, verify, and let the world know through online/offline media which products are the best to buy. That way, when we allow our moral compass to help guide our purchasing decision (when price, quality, and performance are relatively equal in the comparative analysis), we&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s best for us.

Method &#8211; keep up the good work! We marketers still love your brand 😀
