Great new forum I found, established by Summit Publishing to foster the exchange of knowledge surrounding sustainable packaging. According to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.packworld.com/webonly-27179">this Packworld article</a>, the site has four areas:

  1. An awards competition that recognizes outstanding sustainable package design and the application of best practices
  2. A comprehensive product database developed in cooperation with Walmartâ€™s Packaging Scorecard software provider ECRM that will include detailed environmental data on a host of packaging materials
  3. Expert-guided discussion groups specific to packaging sustainability
  4. Interactive news and information updated daily
