Following a referenced 1,600 person interview, people ranked the following packaging features in order of importance:

  * Being recyclable via placement in curbside bins
  * Biodegradability
  * Minimal packaging
  * Recycled content
  * Refillable containers
  * Alternative reuse containers
  * Compostable

The authors point out, as I agree, that it&#8217;s interesting minimal packaging and recycled content were lower ranked, even though these two activities end up producing less material and use fewer virgin materials to begin with.
