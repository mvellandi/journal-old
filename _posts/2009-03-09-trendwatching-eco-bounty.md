<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.trendwatching.com/briefing/full/">Trendwatching.com&#8217;s March 2009 Trend Briefing covering ECO-BOUNTY</a>

Interesting article by on green business/living forecasts, including many photos and graphics. It&#8217;s described as follows:

â€œECO-BOUNTY refers to the numerous opportunities, both short and long term, for brands that participate in the epic quest for a sustainable society. Some of these opportunities exist despite the current recession, others are fueled by it, not in the least because of new rules and regulations. Downturn-obsessed brands who lose their eco-focus will find themselves left out in the cold when the global economy starts recovering.
