#### 12 Sustainable Design Strategies:

  * Design for: use, durability, reuse, disassembly, effectiveness, and systems
  * Dematerialization
  * Materials and Energy Substitution
  * Localization
  * Transmaterialization
  * Informationalization
  * Loop Closing

#### Nathan&#8217;s Quick Tips:

  * Create more (value, meaning, and performance) with less (materials, energy, and virgin materials)
  * Focus on efficient and healthy alternatives
  * Use and promote local energy, resources and labor to reduce transportation
  * Don&#8217;t use PVC unless there is no alternative
  * Design solutions that are so good, they are savored

Also see [Nathan&#8217;s video presentation on sustainable design](../sustainable-designer-nathan-shedroff/), in addition to my review.

Nathan will also be hosting a [webinar on March 25th](http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/webinars/sustainable-design-webinar/).

Lastly, do check out the [folks and blog behind Sustainable Minds](http://www.sustainableminds.com/blog/). They have some great contributions from marketers, designers, and other related field practitioners &#8211; And I hear they make some excellent sustainable design software too ðŸ™‚
