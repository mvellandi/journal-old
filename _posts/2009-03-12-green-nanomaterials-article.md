Great article on what nanomaterials are, and what they hold for us in terms of product innovation.  While there are also concerns about their biological and environmental safety, especially once they&#8217;re released/unbound from their intended confines, their future potential is very bright. Particularly promising applications include pharmaceuticals and chemical cleanups. Secondary benefits include time, water, and energy efficiency.
