Following an industry trend in communicating product ingredients among consumer product manufacturers, SC Johnson has launched <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.whatsinsidescjohnson.com/">WhatsInsideSCJohnson.com</a>. Last month, I did [an informal study of how the major brands performed regarding ingredient communications](../cpgs-and-ingredient-communications/), and it now appears that SC Johnson may be leading the pack ahead of Clorox. See the press release above for more detailed info on their unique approach; note that they&#8217;re also telling the story of how they&#8217;re addressing phthalates to address a specific consumer concern.
