From the [FD Element advertising agency](http://www.fdelement.com) specializing in sustainability and advocacy, here&#8217;s their top five:

  1. __Closer tie between Green Marketing and Overall Brand Image__

    Environmental and social responsibility initiatives will be further tied into overall brand communications.
  2. __Increased Attention to Audience and Customer Engagement__

    Communications and will move from reports and website subsections, to microsites, blogs, and other social media channels for both general and specific audiences. Expect more local and community engagement through activities and special events.
  3. __Smart Ads and Online Video__

    Increased use of video (standard and interactive) through social media channels in addition to portability for mobile devices.
  4. __Goals will be more clearly Identified using Specifics__

    Clear, understandable initiatives; SMART milestones (specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound); Progress tracking (positive and negative); Increased relevant initiatives (ex: offsetting and claiming carbon neutrality will become passe).
  5. __More Partnerships with Environmental Groups__

    The once solid divide between businesses and NGOs will start to relax, as companies begin to take more active roles in conservation, wildlife protection, and other areas of sustainability and issue advocacy.
