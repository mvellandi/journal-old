By the LA Times, comes this great story on sustainable design education and practice at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA &#8211; a university I&#8217;m proud to have just an hour away. Students are encouraged to consider life cycle analysis, material substitution, systemic product manufacturing, and daily living activities and habits that could make a difference. The important thing is not to be preachy on the subject, but rather just to make the students think about the world around them, choices, consequences, and interdependence. Whether a product/service is designed for social or fashion related reasons, it&#8217;s pertinent to ingrain this line of thinking from the beginning so at least we can evolve into a more reasonable consumer-oriented society.

From one of the article&#8217;s mentioned professors, I have a seminar presentation summary which you can read here:
