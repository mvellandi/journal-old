Billboards Switch From Paper and Paste to Recyclable Plastic &#8211; GreenerDesign.com

The polyethylene posters are stretched across billboards and attached with hooks. Quoted from the Greener Design article,

  *&#8220;The 220,000 billboard posters across the U.S. used to be made up of paper and paste, creating about 150 million pounds of waste a year. The PE posters weigh four pounds as opposed to the 40 pounds of material needed for a paper poster. The PE posters also are more water resistant and provide better print quality, according to outdoor advertising companies like Clear Channel. However, they also cost one-and-a-half or two times as much as paper posters, but since they last three times as long, if they stay up for 90 days, the cost evens out.&#8221;*
