Having spoken to the brand manager for Aquafina last year, he told me that in 09 they were going to introduce a 50% reduction in bottle weight. Fairly impressed, I eagerly awaited the news. So somehow the press release missed my filters and Environmental Leader picked up on the story above. Additionally, they&#8217;re removing the cardboard base in 24-packs.

While the action is substantive, the communication about it is a bit lame. If you click on the story, you&#8217;ll see a couple things. The &#8216;Eco-Fina&#8217; graphic branding is completely unnecessary, as whenever you claim **ANY** type of &#8216;eco&#8217; attributes, you&#8217;re opening yourself up as a brand for potential greenwash claims. Just toss the label all together. There&#8217;s nothing intrinsic about the product being eco-friendly. Compostable v. plastic disposable tableware is one thing, but the water product itself has not fundamentally changed. A lighter bottle doesn&#8217;t make for a credible &#8216;eco&#8217; affiliation.

Secondly, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3IgrCozw5Q">there&#8217;s a video</a> that shows the manufacturing/operations process with the aforementioned graphic thrown in, along with this claim: &#8220;Eco-Friendly Packaging is 100% Recyclable&#8221;. Well Doh! Polyethylene Terephthalate (#1) is the common plastic behind all soft drink bottles &#8211; which are most definitely recyclable. The real problem behind bottle recycling is systemic.

Lastly, I came across <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/blogs/aquafina-fails-green-marketing-101">this blog post</a> where a referenced friend received one of these new water bottles, via FedEx Priority Overnight. Now, I&#8217;m always reluctant to blame a brand at large for mistakes &#8211; all organizations are run by individuals. Whoever was responsible for this blogger outreach campaign should have never sent any water bottles&#8230;period. The perceived carbon footprint, waste of packaging, and general adversity by much of the green community (myself excluded) to bottled water, can make a bad impression. So if you&#8217;re targeting bloggers, who are word-of-mouth agents by nature, one should be mindful of some of these considerations.
