Great analysis of how the consumer packaged goods manufacturer is progressing along its sustainability path, a $20 billion sales goal of &#8220;sustainable innovation products&#8221; by 2012, and the issues a product company faces while attempting to innovate sustainably. Lots of loaded words, yes I know, but the author does a far better job than my little one-liner synopsis could dare attempt. But I will leave you with the money quotes:

> *&#8220;How is improvement defined, and against what base?*
>
> *To qualify under the company&#8217;s target, the products have to have been launched in market since July 1st, 2007, and have a greater than ten percent reduction in one or more of the following: energy; water; transportation; material use. Energy use can also mean substituted by renewable sources as well as reduced overall.*
>
> *That is a good, honest, forward–looking measure. It also begs the question as to what progress has been made, and who decides what is good.*
>
> *Given the range of issues across the product range, P&G&#8217;s approach to setting targets for sales of improved product looks worthwhile.*
>
> *What it measures is not environmental impact per se – but how the company is using its key focus on innovation to continue to drive improvement.*
>
> *If one could balance the target out with an ongoing tally of the eco–efficiency of the whole product range – to ensure that the $20bn of sales by 2012 isn&#8217;t balanced out by a similar increase in more damaging products, you have a pretty robust approach.&#8221;*

According to [this SLM article, P&G has now raised its sales goal to $50 billion](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/content/story/strategy/proctor_and_gamble_targets_50_billion_in_green_product_sales).
