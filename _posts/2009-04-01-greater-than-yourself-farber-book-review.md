Once again, Mr. Farber has applied his classic business novel/parable style to his latest book: &#8220;[Greater Than Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385522614?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385522614)&#8220;.

It&#8217;s filled with characters who although are laid-back, friendly, and humble, they&#8217;re also beaming with confidence and an in-the-moment lifestyle based on values, giving, and interpersonal development. Again Steve here has inserted himself as the apprentice who although smart, is a bit wary and joking at first, yet becomes ever more intrigued and committed to the GTY applied philosophy. Combined with a good foreword, real third-party stories of GTY, and a summary process framework, the book makes for an excellent read.

The diagram you see above is my own illustrated summary of the Greater Than Yourself process. Within each of the steps are particular instructions for which you&#8217;d really need to read the book to understand and gain valuable insight. Also see the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://greaterthanyourself.com/">Greater Than Yourself website</a> which has videos and other free resources (with email signup). If you haven&#8217;t read Steve&#8217;s &#8220;[The Radical Leap](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1427797927?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1427797927)&#8220;, do check out some earlier posts of mine for quick goodies:
