Bob Lurie critically addresses two constraining assumptions in questioning whether or not customers will pay a premium for green products:

  1. They do not have any tangible benefits for customers other than making them feel good about helping the planet.
  2. They are more expensive to produce than non-green products.

However, for businesses that understand customer insight and innovation, these assumptions are simply not valid. While Bob&#8217;s explanations are good and self-explanatory (focusing on performance and cost benefits; lean/sustainable manufacturing and logistics), I have the following to add:

The product innovation and communication thereof needs to be aligned with the unique values for various customer segments. The primary factors are the product/service categories and their positioning, followed by target users&#8217; perception of the products&#8217; use and purpose in their lives.

So while a product may have green/social attributes, their effectiveness in stimulating a purchase will depend on, as mentioned:

  * The degree of overall price competitiveness for the category as a whole
  * The percentage of green attributes built into the product (substance matters)
  * How these attributes improve their lives in terms of:
      * Comparative Product Performance
      * Emotional/Spiritual Affinity
      * Financial Savings
