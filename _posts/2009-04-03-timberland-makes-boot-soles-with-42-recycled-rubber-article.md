Nice! The increased use of recycled content percentages is always quite welcome (at least under most circumstances). You see, the general idea is to use whatever material inclusion process with the smallest carbon and long-term waste footprint. This requires:

  * A Basic Life Cycle Assessment
  * Supply Chain Scenario Building
      * Material Costs Analysis (short v. long term; volatility risks)
      * Procurement Process Optimization
      * Materials Requirements Planning & Scheduling (lead time, logistics)
