This article briefly covers bioplastic&#8217;s history, recent developments such as bio propylene and pla with lower carbon footprints than recycled PET, and examines some important remaining systemic hurdles. Cross quoted from an <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ends.co.uk/">Environmental Data Services</a> report,

*“The bottom line is that while many bioplastics do appear to offer substantial environmental gains over conventional materials, much depends on whether they end up being landfilled, incinerated or composted, and how different environmental objectives are weighted,”*
