*&#8220;The launch this month of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.scottcommonsense.com/Scott-Naturals/#ScottNaturalsTissues">Scott Naturals</a> makes <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kimberly-clark.com/">Kimberly-Clark</a> the first major paper products maker to have a full line that taps into the growing market for environmentally friendly products&#8230;Charmin and Bounty maker Procter & Gamble Co does not make recycled paper products, and a spokesman would not comment on any future plans. Georgia-Pacific, whose brands include Quilted Northern, does not have a full line of products marketed as containing recycled fibers, but does have recycled fibers in some of its products, a spokeswoman said&#8230;The Scott Naturals toilet paper has 40 percent recycled fiber, while the paper towels have 60 percent and the napkins, 80 percent&#8230;The cost of the napkins and paper towels is in line with Scott&#8217;s traditional products, while the toilet paper costs 6 percent more because it is more expensive to manufacture.&#8221;*
