<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberger_Druckmaschinen">Heidelberg Druckmaschinen</a> is the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer of offset printing machines with over 40% market share. Recently it launched a web portal dedicated to green printing. From their press release I quote:

  * ‚ÄúGreen Manufacturing‚Äù details Heidelberg‚Äôs environmental policy and green manufacturing processes, and provides a list of environmental milestones achieved by Heidelberg over the past 20 years. Here users can view and download Heidelberg‚Äôs Sustainability Reports from 2003/4 on, all of which detail Heidelberg‚Äôs long-term commitment to environmentally responsible manufacturing.&#8221;* [Oh joy! üòâ ]

  * &#8220;While browsing the ‚ÄúGreen Printshop,‚Äù visitors will learn which Heidelberg products can shrink their environmental footprint by reducing paper waste, energy consumption, VOC emissions and ink residues.&#8221;* [customer benefits from products, good]

  * &#8220;A third section, ‚ÄúGreen Resources‚Äù, compiles third-party tools and information on green printing and sustainability. It includes links to industry associations, environmental councils ‚Äì such as the Sustainable Green Printing Partnership or special programs from the EPA &#8211; carbon calculators, chain-of-custody certifications like SFI and FSC, government resources and information on green design. A special subsection on ‚ÄúMaking Green Claims‚Äù offers guidelines for distinguishing legitimate green marketing claims from spurious competing claims.&#8221;* [probably the best part, since you&#8217;re educating]

While I give much respect to Heidelberg (I&#8217;m half German and appreciate good engineering), I must say the following:

  * This entire website is primarily about Heidelberg. Look how responsible we are! Why are they calling this area a &#8220;green printing web portal&#8221; then? Lame.

  * Create some more meat and guidance for the &#8220;Green Resources&#8221; section. I&#8217;ve seen plenty of paper companies&#8217; special brochures that go in depth just about green printing with only about 30-40% of the material talking about their brand and product offerings.

  * Reverse the order of the sections on the website (left to right), and in the press release descriptions (top to bottom). That way you&#8217;re focusing more on educating the customer and less about brand you. Trust me, it&#8217;s better that way.

  * Put the site on a easy to remember URL, being either a subdomain or a microsite. As it is now, if you&#8217;re giving us <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.us.heidelberg.com/eco">http://www.us.heidelberg.com/eco</a> , don&#8217;t redirect us to a much hell of a longer URL.
