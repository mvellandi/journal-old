The folks at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.muskedunder.com/">Muskedunder Interactive</a> in Sweden made an online game for their client Volvo last year, in promoting the FH16 700 Truck. According to an update email I received from Magnus:

_&#8220;Mainly because of the fantastic performance of the game, [they&#8217;ve had] over 1,2 [million] unique players within two months of launch. The combined play time for all users adds up to over 20 years. We have listened to the feedback from the players and included a longer level with more features and an Easter egg for the hard core players.&#8221;_

Since I like games and found this an engaging example of making people (including non-truckers like me) think of the Volvo brand, I thought I&#8217;d include Part II here for your enjoyment.
