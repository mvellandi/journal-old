While I don&#8217;t shop shoes often, it is refreshing to see a specialty shoe retailer put together a brand that isn&#8217;t overtly green, particularly in its branding and product design. The new line promises sustainably designed shoes, handbags, jewelry, and socks for under $30.

> *&#8220;The Zoe & Zac products are green because they are made from eco-friendly components and materials such as organic cottons and linen, natural hemp, recycled rubber outsoles, eco-friendly-EVA cushioning, and water-based glues for the shoes. Natural materials like dyed Tagua and Acai nuts are incorporated into the jewelry. The product packaging is eco-smart as well, utilizing 100 percent recycled shoe boxes and soy-based inks for the printing.&#8221;*

> *&#8220;The brand stresses an &#8220;invisibly green,&#8221; fashion-first position with regular seasonal updates to reflect the latest trends such as popular silhouettes, key colors and other styling details. Zoe & Zac is expected to evolve to a green brand for the family with expanded products for girls, as well as future offerings for men and boys.&#8221;*

I&#8217;m happy for the direction the company took, and hope it serves as a good example of making green a normal and invisible aspect of both the product design and brand communications &#8211; because it&#8217;s just the right thing to do. Hopefully hypermarkets Wal-Mart and Target will take on similar initiatives with any house-brand and contract shoe/accessory manufacturing they do.

I&#8217;ve sold American designed, Chinese made products to both retailers in the past, and cheap chic without any social/environmental concerns was the norm in 2005. It&#8217;s my truest hope that all fashion (low-priced and premium) can be sustainable.
