> *&#8220;The Sage Group conducted a web-based research study called, “My Views on Environmentally Friendly Packaging,” and delivered it to nearly 800 multiple-generation “friends” via an email or a Facebook link and took care to use commonly understood terms. For example, the survey didn&#8217;t refer to “sustainable packaging,” because 89 percent of consumers don&#8217;t know what it means. Queries ranged from, “What makes a company or brand environmentally friendly?” to “How does that friendliness affect purchasing decisions?”&#8221;*

See the article above for generational differences on a variety of topics. Here are the common findings among all groups:<br />

  * *They believe they can have a significant impact on the environment.*
  * *They seek data on the environmental impact of a product and its packaging on which to base purchasing decisions.*
  * *They view “hard-packaging” and over-packaging as environmentally destructive.*
  * *They&#8217;re unaware of the sustainability nuances of the various types of packaging materials (plastic is bad, glass is good, reused materials are good, etc.).*
  * *To them, sustainable packaging is recyclable packaging. Period.*
  * *They avoid buying from companies they perceive as having a bad reputation—ethically or environmentally.*
  * *They recognize greenwashing when they see it. Authenticity and transparency are essential to them.*
