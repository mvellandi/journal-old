[Ecovative Design](http://www.ecovativedesign.com/) is a firm established by two young entrepreneurs who invented a process for making an alternative to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_polystyrene#Foams">expanded polystyrene</a> (aka <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrofoam">Styrofoam</a> from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dow.com">Dow Chemical</a>). The unique part is that the material is made from fungi and agricultural waste. Their two products include Acorn (compostable packaging material), and Greensulate (organic insulation material). According to this NY Times article,

> *&#8220;Both are both produced through microbinding, in which local agricultural waste — including buckwheat, rice and cottonseed hulls and other materials high in lignin, a complex organic polymer found in many plants — is mixed with cells from a specific type of fungi.&#8221; *
>
> *&#8220;Within about a week, Mr. Bayer said, the fungus digests the lignin, producing a strong biological matrix. The mixture is poured into a mold and then dehydrated, creating the finished product.&#8221;*

I seriously wish them the best of luck with their enterprise. For more info, see the video below:
