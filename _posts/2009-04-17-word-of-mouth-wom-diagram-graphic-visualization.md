Design Thinker [David Armano](http://darmano.typepad.com/) posted a [graphic design contest](http://darmano.typepad.com/logic_emotion/2009/03/visualize-word-of-mouth-get-a-free-pass-to-wommau.html) about 3 weeks ago for a free pass to the [Word of Mouth Marketing Association&#8217;s Seminar in mid May](http://www.womma.org/wommu/). So I busted out the following graphic in about 5 hours of work, to convey some of my thoughts on what WOM means. Please note that I&#8217;ve exagerated negative WOM in this sample scenario only because promotors and super brand evangelists get a lot of marketers attention. Yet, there are many controversial subjects (as opposed to brands) that get booed all the time. Personally, I feel that more people like to share positivity than negativity, because it&#8217;s a reflection of who we are, and we probably would rather be perceived as positive. More notes below the graphic.

<a title="Word of Mouth - Visualized by mvellandi, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mvellandi/3427749387/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3300/3427749387_162d4d9138_z.jpg?zz=1" alt="Word of Mouth - Visualized" width="640" height="553" /></a>

While an infographic should be self-explanatory, I will explain some of the thoughts behind my concept:

  * At a basic level, there are at least 5 types of affinity levels from detest to love.
  * People increasingly are inclined to tell others when their feelings toward like or dislike become stronger.
  * Indifferent opinions have little propensity to be shared, unless if feedback is solicited.
  * Some nodes have the opportunity to tell a LOT of people and influence their opinion (whether fully formed and objective or not).
  * Highlighting different recipient reactions than from the original transmitter is reflective of reality; we don&#8217;t all share the same degrees of like/dislike, no matter who the influencer was nor how they communicated their opinion.
  * There are some experiences that we may not want to share with a lot of people because of their personal nature, be they positive or embarrassing (for ourselves or others). Another circumstance could be that we learn something valuable, but out of self- or group-interest, we want to keep this knowledge just to ourselves or a very limited number of people.
  * Everything depends on the quality of the idea first.

With that said, I&#8217;d like to point out one flaw I noticed in my diagram. Sandwhiching the label Detractors between the two big groups at the bottom could make one think all those people ARE detractors, when in fact they&#8217;re just recipients of the previous node&#8217;s recommendation, which itself is exagerrated according to the probabilistic behavior of nodes earlier in the tree.

Anyways, hope you enjoy it! Feel free to share along, as it&#8217;s under the following [Creative Commons License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en)
