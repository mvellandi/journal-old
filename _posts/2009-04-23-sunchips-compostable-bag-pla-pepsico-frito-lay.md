Okay, I just had to have some fun with the title. The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sunchips.com/">Sun Chips brand</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://fritolay.com/">Frito-Lay</a>, a division of PepsiCo, announced the following in their press release:

> *&#8220;This month, the SunChips brand is taking the first step towards this transformational packaging. The outer layer of packaging on 10 ½ oz size SunChips snacks bags will be made with a compostable, plant-based renewable material, polylactic acid (PLA).   By Earth Day 2010, PepsiCo&#8217;s Frito-Lay North America division plans to rollout a package for its SunChips snacks where all layers are made from PLA material so the package is 100% compostable.*
>
> *“We know environmentally-friendly packaging is a priority for our SunChips consumer,” said Gannon Jones, vice president, marketing, Frito-Lay North America. “Today’s launch of packaging made with 1/3 renewable materials is an important first step towards having a fully compostable chip bag in market by Earth Day 2010.”*
>
> *Current snack food packaging has three layers: a printed outer layer with packaging visuals/graphics, an inner layer, which serves as a barrier to maintain the quality and integrity of the product, and a middle layer that joins the other two layers. When the packaging is 100% compostable, it will fully decompose in about 14 weeks when placed in a hot, active compost pile or bin.  NatureWorks LLC is providing the PLA, which is trademarked under the Ingeo name.&#8221;*

If you read the whole press release, you&#8217;ll also see how they&#8217;re going to be communicating this to retailers and people. Seems like they&#8217;re really gonna be baking the compostable bag aspect as an intrinsic part of their brand identity &#8211; from the earth, powered by wind, no product waste. I wonder though if the bag is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6400.htm">ASTM D6400 certified</a>? Seems like that would be plausible and no big deal.

So here&#8217;s the thing though. While Sun Chips is doing the best they can on their own, the fact remains that 99.9% of bags will never die peacefully in a hot, active compost bin or facility. They&#8217;ll either be landfilled or in a few cases, burned. But at least in those end-of-life scenarios, they&#8217;re made of bio-based materials and I suppose that&#8217;s better than monstrous hybrids of organic/inorganic materials.

By the way, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sustainablelifemedia.com/events/sb09/schedule">SunChips will be giving a special discussion at Sustainable Brands 09 on Tuesday June 2nd</a>, titled **Sunchip&#8217;s Sustainable Brand Journey: Thinking Outside (And About) the Bag!** &#8211; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sustainablelifemedia.com/events/SB09/speakers/bios#toh">Thomas Oh</a>, Director of Marketing, _Frito Lay_
