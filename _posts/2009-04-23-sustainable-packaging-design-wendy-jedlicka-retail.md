Wendy is the author of [Packaging Sustainability: Tools, Systems and Strategies for Innovative Package Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470246693?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0470246693 "Check out Wendy's book on Amazon") (I got the book last week and am dying to eat it up), and gave a pretty good interview.

> *&#8220;It&#8217;s really a matter of &#8211; you know, they go hand in glove. You can&#8217;t separate one from the other. It always cracks me up when people are like, “Oh, yeah. Show me all these great eco examples that you&#8217;ve done that are super cutting edge.” And I go, “Here you go.” And they go, “Well, that&#8217;s just a box.” And it&#8217;s like, “Yeah, but let me tell you about all the stuff we didn&#8217;t put in the box and let me tell you about this or this stuff that we did, and let me tell you about what we optimized in the pallet and&#8230;” They&#8217;re like, “Yeah, but it&#8217;s just a box. It doesn&#8217;t look eco.”*
>
> *Well, you know, what is eco? Eco is a system. Green is a box. You know, put recycled on there, put a symbol, paint it green, make it look like bark and you&#8217;re done. But if you really want to do something eco, if you want to do something that&#8217;s sustainable, if you want to do something that&#8217;s the next level, you have to look at the supply chain, and if you take a look at the people that have been doing sustainability as part of their core ethic for quite some time, they are looking at the entirety of the supply chain&#8221;*

Regarding clients:

> *&#8220;Are they coming to me better educated now? Not necessarily. They are coming to me more motivated. (In the past) I would have to take about 80 percent of the conversation to explain why going to a more sustainable solution set or supply chain or business system is even worth doing because they&#8217;re like, “Oh, it&#8217;s that greenie thing, isn&#8217;t it?” And it&#8217;s like, “No, no, no. Not a greenie thing. Here, let me put it in words you love &#8211; profitability, resource use, efficiency,&#8221; and start to pull out the words that they&#8217;re used to hearing and then they&#8217;re like, “Oh, well, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. Well, I didn&#8217;t know that. Well, why don&#8217;t they just say that?”&#8221;*

One last thing Wendy mentions is how club stores paved much of the way for sustainable packaging, before Wal-Mart at large stepped in with its <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sustainability-education.com/">Sustainable Packaging Scorecard</a> program. With club stores (Costco, Sam&#8217;s Club, other Cash & Carry stores), the warehouse is the store itself with stock kept on shelves above the merchandise.

To quickly prepare items for sale, the pallets have to be specially designed by layers with corner protectors. I&#8217;ve been commissioned to oversee the designs for previous employers and must say it&#8217;s not an easy process because now marketing & product development also has to please the buyer in this extra regard. Granted, it&#8217;s not too much different than designing a POP or floor display in that we should consider designing the whole pallet to be appealing and inviting (&#8220;come hither and take a closer look!&#8221;). But the main difference is that displays need to be assembled, club pallets don&#8217;t. All inner and master cartons are eliminated from the supply chain. I can go on an on with this subject, but I&#8217;ll leave it be for now while your precious attention is still here, and leave you with a Wal-Mart video on Packaging 2.0 which (aside from the corporate &#8220;We Care&#8221; speak), gives you a rough idea of the larger supply chain factors at work that Wendy describes in the last part of the GreenBiz interview.
