Reductionism is both a classic technique for placing greater user focus on select elements of an object/process, and for lean & sustainable product development. One major design proponent of reductionism is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda">John Maeda</a>, dean of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.risd.edu/">Rhode Island School of Design (RISD</a>) &#8211; Although not explicitly related to sustainability, I do recommend you <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lawsofsimplicity.com/">check out some of his writings</a>. So after reading a recent post by Scot Herbst of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lunar.com">Lunar Design</a>, titled [Conservation is not done with the pen…it’s done with an axe](http://iconocast.typepad.com/iconocast/2009/04/conservation-is-not-done-with-the-penits-done-with-an-axe.html), I got to thinking how valuable this valuable philosophy and approach is. It encompasses what [Wendy Jedlicka talked about in her recent interview with GreenBiz](../sustainable-packaging-design-wendy-jedlicka-retail/).

Scot notes in the article some of their work with Hewlett-Packard:

> *&#8220;Last fall HP started delivering the Touchsmart PC,  a gorgeous piece that exudes ‘less’ while offering the consumer ‘more.’ We shed the oversized metal box and integrated the CPU and display into a single compact gesture that reduces part-count and shrinks the shipping footprint considerably.*
>
> *Most notably, the product reduces material usage by 50% (primarily plastic and steel). It has also successfully helped catalyze a paradigm shift in consumer perception of size and desirability. HP is now defining this emerging category as the Single Volume Product (SVP). SVP is a more dynamic solution to the part and feature consolidation that was originally introduced in the All-In-One computer (i.e., Apple IMac).&#8221;*

A great quick case study indeed. How many other products can we envision redesigned?

One commentator in that article pointed out a common critique of product companies, in that selling &#8220;more&#8221; is the goal. If so, that seems contradictory to sustainability at large. I replied with the following:

> *&#8220;The solution lies in business design and addressing the fundamental question: what are we selling?<br /> This may yield scenarios where an increased number of services versus products are delivered over the customer lifespan. *
>
> *Alternatively, there&#8217;s the option of leasing/rental versus ownership. Profit margins in these scenarios often be higher than outright sales. Secondly, the business would automatically address the increasing concern for extended producer responsibility and disposal.&#8221;*

These are some options. Whether we apply strict reductionism to save on material complexity & costs, or design services for various reasons, the ultimate sustainable goal is to make money, and be socially & environmentally proactive & responsible.
