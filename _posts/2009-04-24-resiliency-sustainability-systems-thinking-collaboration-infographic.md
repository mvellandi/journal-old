A few days ago, I read a fantastic article: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4851">Foreign Policy: The Next Big Thing: Resilience</a>. In it, environmental futurist Jamais Cascio describes some of the primary differences between the philosophical construct of sustainability versus resiliency, and describes the latter as what&#8217;s needed with the following words:

> *&#8220;As we look ahead, we need to strive for an environment, and a civilization, able to handle unexpected changes without threatening to collapse. Such a world would be more than simply sustainable; it would be regenerative and diverse, relying on the capacity not only to absorb shocks like the popped housing bubble or rising sea levels, but to evolve with them. In a word, it would be resilient.&#8221;*

He goes on to describe the following 8 principles below. Please <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4851">read the article</a>; I promise it&#8217;s brief. Without context, the nice little graphic I drew below won&#8217;t mean jack. To read more from Jamais, please [visit his blog: Open the Future](http://openthefuture.com/).
