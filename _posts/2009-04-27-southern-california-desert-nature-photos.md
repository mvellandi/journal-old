A little break from the usual bout of topics, I bring you today a slideshow of photos I had taken while on a day trip to the Arizona border and back. It includes landscapes, plants, flowers, grasshoppers, and a family of owls!

Taken with an 8mp Canon SLR without a telephoto lens, digitally zooming in & cropping and adjusting contrast and levels where needed, and selecting the best photos for sharing. Enjoyez!
