#### [Persuasive design for sustainability &#8211; Core77](http://www.core77.com/blog/book_reviews/persuasive_design_for_sustainability_13215.asp)

Came across this great article by Jeremy Faludi recently that I had to share. Largely based on interaction design principles, here&#8217;s the article&#8217;s outline:

  * __Tools__**:** Make a behavior easier or more convenient; Calculate / simulate / measure; Give feedback; Persuasive media; Cause-and-effect simulations; Rehearse behavior; Environment simulations; Telling the backstory.
  * **Social Actors:** Rewards / punishments; Liking / attractiveness; Reciprocity; Nagging; Modeling a behavior / attitude; Social support.
  * **Levels & Locations of Persuasion:** Macro- and Microsuasion**.**
  * __Summary__

Money Quote:

> *&#8220;Persuasive technology isn&#8217;t inherently green&#8211;in fact, we are already living in a world with design biases that push our behavior towards overconsumption, irresponsibility, and shortsightedness. We need to short circuit those existing persuasions, and steer users in the right direction. Knowing how objects persuade can help us do this, and using persuasive strategies can encourage more sustainable user habits in everything from building design to transportation design, from computers to coffee makers to clothing.*

> *One last thing to consider about persuasive design is the ethics of the tactics you use, and the agendas which your persuasion promotes. Use your super-powers only for good. There can be a fine line between making things convenient and making things constrictive, or between educating the user with knowledge and manipulating them with propaganda. In our efforts to create a brighter greener future, we have to remember the means are as important as the ends, because by the definition of sustainable design, better means __are__ the ends we seek.&#8221;*
