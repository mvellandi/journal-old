Great presentation I came across online. Transforming products to services is one strategy for sustainable design. Since my professional background traces to product management and development, service design is a bit of a new field for me to learn & understand. I hope this presentation by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://adaptivepath.com/aboutus/brandon.php">Brandon Schauer</a> helps shed some important light on the subject!
