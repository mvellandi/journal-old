I&#8217;m a sucker for awesome infographics. Erik Roscam Abbing of the [Brand Driven Innovation](http://www.branddriveninnovation.com/) blog, posted a [sweet graphical model](http://www.branddriveninnovation.com/2009/02/24/new-brand-relationship-model/) that he&#8217;s developed to portray his model of corporate brands and the relationship between the organisation and the user, and between marketing and product development.

To find the corresponding focus points for any specific quadrant, just jump right across (up/down, left/right) to the same level. [See the post for further clarification](http://www.branddriveninnovation.com/2009/02/24/new-brand-relationship-model/). I&#8217;ll leave you with Erik&#8217;s purpose with the model:

> *&#8220;For the brand to function as the basis for building relationships it has to be rooted deep within the organization. It has to answer the question ‘why are we here as an organization?’ On the other hand, when working on a brand that drives short term new product development in a practical and tangible manner, a compelling brand promise that everyone understands, and can work with, may be perfectly suitable. A nail needs a hammer and a screw needs a screwdriver.&#8221;<br /> *
>
> *&#8220;What the model also does is help define the topic of the discussion. And that’s always crucial when talking about branding and design.&#8221;*

If you have anything to add, please leave a comment at his post.

Great Job!
