  - Now, the branding question-- some of our products are branded, and others aren’t; this is the case at around a 1:1 ratio at present.

A few weeks ago, I wrote an article on how [Mars was teaming up with Terracycle to create new products](../terracycle-mars-waste-product-development/ "Mars Terracycle product development partnership") along with some commentary on the role of sustainable products not just being useful, but also desirable for the long term. It&#8217;s one thing to create a relatively &#8220;green&#8221; and socially responsible product, but it&#8217;s also important that we try and extend its useful life as far as we can before likely being landfilled/incinerated, or maybe recycled.

So into Facebook comes a reply from Greg who works at Terracycle, addressing my questions:

> Hey Mario,
>
> First, thanks for writing about TerraCycle! I noticed your post and I thought I’d write to answer your questions.
>
> Naturally there are constraints on products made from trash – it’s challenging because it’s never been done on this scale before! With every new product, and the subsequent redesign of each product, they become more refined. That process will absolutely continue.
>
> Now, the branding question: some of our products are branded, and others aren’t; this is the case at around a 1:1 ratio at present. The cool part about developing this new business model is that we can take it in any direction we like. We’re currently testing new ways to work with these materials for consumer and industrial purposes; when these products go into production it will drastically shift the balance toward unbranded materials. Based on the prototypes, you won’t even be able to tell what the material source is.
>
> McDonough’s “Cradle to Cradle” is a huge inspiration for TerraCycle, as is Hawken’s “Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.” The principles found in these brilliant books are in mind throughout our whole process. We do let people know that if they get tired of their drink pouch lunch box, for example, that they can return it to us.
>
> As we continue to scale this crazy idea, TerraCycle becomes more of an inspiration to people around the world. Whether it’s the kids who learn to waste less via our brigades, or people who apply our ideas to other waste streams to create sustainable products – there’s an almost limitless supply at this point – the fact is that we’re making an impact on the marketplace, as well as generations of people, whether they buy into our idea enough to purchase TerraCycle products or not.
>
> I hope this helps answer some of your questions, and I hope we’ll have a chance to discuss in greater detail soon!
>
> Cheers, George

There you go.
