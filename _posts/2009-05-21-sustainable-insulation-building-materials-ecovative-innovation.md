I found myself a fan of a relatively new company [Ecovative](http://www.ecovativedesign.com/) that eventually WILL hit the covers of Fast Company and other magazines. They are B2B and that excites me, since Terracycle is already the rage in consumer products. I covered them briefly before, but [here&#8217;s a couple videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/EcovativeDesign) to whet your appetite.

I particularly like their use of storytelling through video, and how their founder is employing personality marketing as the Spokesperson. Eventually, they&#8217;ll want to have home builders, packaging people, and others want to share their fan stories too. But that will have to be organically grown and not officially affiliated with Ecovative (otherwise it won&#8217;t be authentic and impressive).
