Last night I was considering the communications process from a Taoist philosophical perspective, considering the Subjective (listening, inspiration, stories, advice), and Objective (inquiry, theory, case studies, directives).

Both leaders and followers, organizations and consumers, will switch between both frames depending on their conscious/unconscious state of participation. For greater effectiveness in interpersonal communications, it is helpful to be cognizant of which frame we&#8217;re using and perhaps switch back and forth.

To take the concept further, we could also add the dimension of participation levels: Active/Proactive v. Passive/Reactive

**What do you think?**
