Neat [new campaign](http://www.healthymagination.com) by [General Electric](http://www.ge.com/) that showcases various videos on its activities in the health care space. What&#8217;s interesting is on slide [5/14 on the About Page](http://www.healthymagination.com/#/about), they have this to say:

> _&#8220;It&#8217;s GE&#8217;s commitment to making sustainable health a reality, beginning today._
>
> _In the past few years, our ecomagination commitment has applied our scale and innovation toward environmental challenged. Now, in that same spirit, healthymagination will offer dramatic new investments toward achieveing sustainable health. It&#8217;s all part of our dedication to tackling the world&#8217;s toughest challenges._
>
> _But addressing an issue this big &#8212; and this important &#8212; can&#8217;t be done alone. So we are extending invitations to partners with a similar passion and vision to make it happen.&#8221;_

So the microsite is done fairly well, and the campaign serves as a unique way that GE is trying to bring light to additional company investments in its health care division. This is dovetail marketing from the [Ecomagination program](http://ge.ecomagination.com/).

As a point of reference, another global firm with a larger presence in this field is [Siemens (see global healthcare site here)](http://www.medical.siemens.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay~q_catalogId~e_-11~a_langId~e_-11~a_storeId~e_10001.htm).
