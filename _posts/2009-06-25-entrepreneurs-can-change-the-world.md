What a video! The elements that make it powerful is the invitation to imagine/remember childhood and the piano music.

Interestingly missing is the traditional pomp & triumphal imagery and glorious music meant to celebrate the individual, meant to unconsciously promote objective selfishness. Instead, the communication is focused on the process of actualizing, the benefit that entrepreneurs can bring to society, the potential within us To Lead. To Start. To Innovate.

And that&#8217;s a deeper message underlying the entrepreneurial spirit: Hope + Creativity + Action

In essence, one doesn&#8217;t need to start or own a business. It&#8217;s about the capability to have a vision and see it through.

If we can change the map of how we see the world and our place in it, then it&#8217;s very possible to progress to a revitalized vision of what we truly want to see happen. For us. For ourselves. For what matters most to us.
