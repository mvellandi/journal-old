As [quoted from the Envirowise website for PACK-IN](http://www.envirowise.gov.uk/uk/Our-Services/Tools/PACK-IN-The-Packaging-Indicator-tool-for-eco-design.html):

*&#8220;Measuring the overall environmental impact of a packaging system can be difficult and time consuming. This web-based tool simplifies this task by allowing you to assess packaging and also compare different packaging options using a small number of pre-defined environmental parameters.*

*The tool builds an environmental profile of your packaging system using the following information:*

*Types and amounts of materials you are using (or intending to use) in your packaging*

*Information on where the materials come from and how they are transported to your facility*

*Data on volume of product and packaging*

*The tool then presents the results in both graphical and tabular formats based on six parameters: recycled content, recyclability, product/pack ratio, volumetric efficiency, embodied carbon and transport.&#8221;*

I haven&#8217;t used it personally, but if you do know someone in the packaging space, do let them know about it ðŸ™‚

There is an increasing number of free and premium SAAS (software as a service) tools for eco-design available. I hope to cover more of them in future posts.
