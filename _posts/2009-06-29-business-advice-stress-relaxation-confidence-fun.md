About 7 weeks ago, I received a review copy of [&#8220;Rules of Thumb&#8221; by Alan Webber](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061721832?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061721832) as a gift from their agent. Instead of making a comprehensive book review, I thought I&#8217;d break down the 52 rules on life and business into various posts, using a bit of Alan&#8217;s writing and personal perspective as I read through it. That way it&#8217;s helpful to us all 🙂

## **&#8220;When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Relax&#8221;**

Alan recounts being an associate editor for the Harvard Business Review in the early 80s, and describes a live interview opportunity he&#8217;d received with then German Chancellor, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Schmidt">Helmut Schmidt</a>. Now this gent was apparently known to be a bit &#8220;better-than-thou&#8221; with people asking questions, so Alan had good reason to feel a bit nervous. Before Helmut walked in, he wrote a couple key reference phrases at the top of his pad, along the lines of

> *&#8220;Relax! Smile! This is a blessing, a treat, and an honor. It&#8217;s not a punishment to be endured.&#8221;*

That&#8217;s the key. When we&#8217;re in situations where there&#8217;s great opportunity, we all can tense up, and perhaps think of all the things that can go wrong. If we dwell on them, a little whirlwind or slight breezes of negative thinking can hinder the best in us from coming out, reaching out, and giving our best &#8211; unconsciously, naturally. I liken such scenarios to black-or-white thinking: a dangerous pool to be wading in even if we&#8217;re looking on the extreme bright side of things, because overconfidence may hinder us from great interpersonal interaction, while also inflating expectations and potentially setting ourselves up for a big letdown, which may result in lame emotional reasoning. I think you get the point.

Alan further expands on this by mentioning <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Dr._W._Edward_Deming.27s_14_points">W. Edward Deming&#8217;s 8th point in total quality management</a>: **

> *&#8220;Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.&#8221;*,

but stresses that the starting place lies within US. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, having a relaxed composure and confident attitude ensures that we&#8217;ll have a good time &#8211; no matter what the outcome is. After all, things may not go favorably, predictably, or easily for a variety of reasons. Given that, isn&#8217;t it then worthwhile to ensure you at least made the best of it and smile?

> *&#8220;Don&#8217;t let fear undermine your chance to do that one thing you&#8217;ve wanted to do&#8230;Take a second and smile. Enjoy the trip.&#8221;*
