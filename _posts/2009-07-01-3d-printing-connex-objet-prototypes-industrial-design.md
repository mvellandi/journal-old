A neat thing about 3d printing, apart from being uber rad to begin with, is that the idea of quickly developing prototypes speeds up the product development process and, to a degree, is sustainable in the sense of not using multiple materials and creating waste. Gotta love the direction of this video too, with the Myriad font, Danny Elfman like music, and the feeling of wonder and perhaps desire created, although yes it&#8217;s very geeky ðŸ˜›
