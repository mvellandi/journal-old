This article talks about China and its government&#8217;s consideration of philosophy&#8217;s role (Confucianism, Taosim, Buddhism) as a moral groundwork for sustainability and the preservation of natural capital. Since I&#8217;m a student of eastern philosophy, it grabbed me right away. There is a distinct role for living philosophy to play in the direction of people&#8217;s lives, organizational, and societal behavior.

Faith and philosophy can play a massive role in the world&#8217;s transformation to an increasingly sustainable society,at least from a personal living and consumption habits standpoint. What it comes down to, across all religions/philosophies, is the understanding of interdependence, cause/effects, and generalized systems thinking.

It&#8217;s my hope that these last lines of thought can reach wider social reach, because from my point of view (and belief that we&#8217;re inherently wired to care), this acts as a preemptive psychological mechanism for always doing the right thing to begin with, or at least being more prone to consider the causes & effects of actions we (may sometimes for various reasons) take. Both self and other-interest can be served.

But back to the story though. If many of China&#8217;s citizens accept the moral responsibility to ensure the future livelihoods of their children, where does that leave America? Much of this country is agnostic, much of it Christian. The orthodoxic nature of Christianity has been world-renowned to place social/interpersonal care at the top of its agenda, but drastically less-so nature.

Given the American affinity toward pluralism of faiths and ideologies, the burden will be on each of them to integrate this systemic thinking and care for nature into its teachings. It is my sincere belief that many of today&#8217;s ills cannot be solely addressed through reactivity and compassion. Rather, we must smartly address the cause of many sorrows. Leadership, Education, and Awareness is the essential first step, followed by rational guidance.
