From Ralf Beuker <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/iterations">@iterations</a>, comes this awesome diagram he posted on Flickr last month (click on picture or <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ralfbeuker/3324788163/sizes/o/">here for full detail version</a>). Here&#8217;s his official description:

> *&#8220;In the course of the strategic collaboration with my friend and business partner Erik Roscam Abbing from <a href="http://zilverinnovation.com/">Zilverinnovation.com</a> we&#8217;ve recently dedicated a whole day on framing our key areas of expertise in a meaningful concept.*
>
> *What we came up with is a map that is defining our view on what a &#8216;Design Strategy&#8217; actually comprises and how to transform &#8216;Design Strategy&#8217; into actionable, logic steps.*
>
> *In order to give interested folks a better idea on the tools and outcomes of our approach we&#8217;ve added some examples from recent client projects as well.&#8221;*

Great job guys! Love it ðŸ˜€
