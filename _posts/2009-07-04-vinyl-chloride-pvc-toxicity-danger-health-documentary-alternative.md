Highlight clips put together from the documentary &#8220;Blue Vinyl&#8221; &#8211; <a rel="nofollow" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0303307/">http://imdb.com/title/tt0303307/</a>

I put this together because the story needs to be told to a larger audience. It was originally produced in 2002, before the era of YouTube. Right now it&#8217;s collecting dust in distribution neverland.

The documentary film discusses the history of vinyl and its toxicity in the context of investigative journalism, with the backstory of the director&#8217;s parent&#8217;s decision to use blue vinyl siding for their house. Remarkable story in all, but what it shows us is the danger this plastic holds within its entire life cycle. Consumer exposure to vinyl & PVC in a solid, fabricated state is relatively benign. But what about when babies or pets are putting PVC toys in their mouths and chewing on it? Ewww! Secondly, the vinyl chloride presents a health and environmental hazard in its production, fabrication, and end-of-life scenarios. Recycling options are practically non-existent. The big evil byproduct are <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioxin">Dioxins</a>.

The father of Green Chemistry and EPA Research Chief [Paul Anastas](http://www.chem.yale.edu/faculty/anastas.html), has been quite vocal about supporting its elimination and calling for innovating practical alternatives. Let&#8217;s look at the practical steps for achieving the solution:

  * Chemical innovation and funding for developing substitutes for the applications in which vinyl & PVC are currently used
  * Designers and Engineers seeking alternative materials first
  * Consumer education about the issues, and practical advice on how they can adjust their purchasing habits
  * Retailer pressure to avoid purchasing items with these materials and/or category managers expressing avoidance preferences (vocal/written) in new-item RFPs (request for proposal) and during presentations
  * Groundswell support for companies using safe alternative materials; developing effective marketing copy and social media campaigns that stress product benefits first, human health & social responsibility second, price third, environmental benefits fourth.

So these clips constitute 21.4% (21min of 98min total). Under &#8220;Fair Use&#8221; for the purposes of review and citizen journalism, I hope that these curated segments will be not only legal to show, but also interesting for viewers.
