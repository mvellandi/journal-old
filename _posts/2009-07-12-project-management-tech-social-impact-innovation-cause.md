So I came across this marvelous new book out of the UK called [Social by Social](http://www.socialbysocial.com/book/social-by-social), available in print and online. Here&#8217;s some snippets from their [About page](http://www.socialbysocial.com/book/about-book):

> *Social by Social is a practical guide to using new technologies to create social impact. It makes accessible the tools you need to engage a community, offer services, scale up activities and sustain projects. Whoever you are, it shows you how to take technology and turn it into real world benefits.*
>
> *We want to help people in the public and third sectors do more good, by showing them the power of these technologies and how to access them. In the process, we hope we can also educate funders and policy workers about the huge shift of mindset and expectations needed to commission these projects successfully, to give the innovators more space to work.*
