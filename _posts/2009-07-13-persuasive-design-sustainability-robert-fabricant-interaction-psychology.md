I met Robert last month at [Sustainable Brands 09](http://sustainablebrands09.com), where he discussed this same topic. This video though, comes from the Interaction 09 conference by the [IxDA](http://ixda.org). While you can watch the whole video if you&#8217;d like, I would recommend at least watching from 42:30, during which he talks about the South African mobile health/AIDS project (quite fascinating!).

In his own words:

> *At the core of all sustainability efforts is behavior change of some kind. Too much of the discussion within the design community has focused on materials and processes, as exemplified by initiatives like the <a href="http://www.designersaccord.org/">Designers Accord</a>. Yet most of the negative impacts of product and services do not occur at the point of consumption, but through ongoing use. There is a growing awareness amongst Interaction Designers that we must play a central role in understanding existing patterns of behavior and developing new models for motivating meaningful, sustainable behavior change.*
>
> *To date these efforts have relied on a very rational approach, overlaying additional layers of information onto the products we use to help us better evaluate different choices and see the impact of our behavior. While the reasoning behind this approach is sound, it assumes a very rational, considered response from the consumer. However, we know that most decisions are irrational, particularly when we are presented with overwhelming amounts of data (just look at the financial markets). In order to motivate people to make sustainable changes in their behavior we must appeal to their emotions instead.*
>
> *This talk will provide an overview of existing design approaches, what is working and not working. Ideas from Cognitive Psychology and Behavioral Economics will be considered in framing a discussion around new approaches that might achieve more meaningful and sustainable impacts.*
