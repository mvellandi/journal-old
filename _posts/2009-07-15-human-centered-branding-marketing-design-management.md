There&#8217;s a variety of factors that make a brand appealing. The traditional marketing principles are still important, but the last five years have shown us that a shift to humanistic branding and personal engagement is increasingly important for gaining and retaining customers. Some of this might imply trying to create a passion brand. In other ways, it can be conceived as doing a better job of customer service.

In the other realm of design/innovation though, there&#8217;s a massive contribution to the brand in terms of desirability, appeal, and when done exceptionally well: evangelism. Some of this is visible, such as function and aesthetics. Other areas though, like interaction design lie under the radar. Both of these are just as important as the marketing functions. They all have to meld together nicely. It can be extremely difficult, especially if this holistic mindset and its benefits are not fully understood and applied, or financial and human resources just aren&#8217;t available.

So [Erik](http://www.branddriveninnovation.com/) put together this presentation below that highlights much of this thinking in a very thorough manner, using BMW as the example. A service business can just as easily apply. Enjoy!
