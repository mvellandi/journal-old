It champions industrial design as a tool to address social issues, a vehicle for global life improvement, and a catalyst for individual and community empowerment and it encourages the reorientation of the design industry towards a more socially-impactful and humanitarian entity through a variety of Initiatives that include design thinking, production and distribution, funding, design academics, and local chapter projects. The &#8220;H&#8221; in Project H stands for Humanity, Habitats, Health, and Happiness.&#8221;*
