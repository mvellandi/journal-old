I bought his book &#8220;[A Fine Line](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470451025?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470451025)&#8221; a couple weeks ago and am dying to dig through it in the coming weeks. Here&#8217;s some info from the [official website](http://www.afinelinebook.com/):

*A Fine Line offers a step-by-step overview of the innovation process — from targeting goals to shepherding new products and services to the marketplace — in order to reveal how to arrive at an authentic human design that connects strongly with consumers. With a unique perspective, rich stories, and a global mindset, Esslinger explores business solutions that are environmentally sustainable and contribute to an enduring global economy.*

*Hartmut Esslinger is the founder of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.frogdesign.com/">frog design, inc</a>., a leading global innovation firm, and one of the most respected designers and business consultants in the world. Esslinger sparked a design revolution when he founded frog design in his native Germany around the guiding principle “form follows emotion.” His work has defined the modern consumer aesthetic with such revolutionary products as the Apple Macintosh computer, Sony&#8217;s Trinitron television, Lufthansa&#8217;s brand and fleet image, Disney&#8217;s Cruise Lines and Consumer Electronics, and Louis Vuitton&#8217;s brand aesthetic. His designs are in the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum in New York. He is also Founding Professor of the Hochschule für Gestaltung in Karlsruhe, Germany and Professor for Convergent Design at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna, Austria.*
