From the YouTube page&#8217;s description:

> *<a rel="nofollow" href="http://ideo.com">IDEO</a> CEO Tim Brown says that communications technology is leading us back to the kind of participation economy that existed before the industrial revolution such that a great product or service is no longer defined as something where the customer doesn&#8217;t have to do anything. A good service will be defined as one that draws customers in as participants.*
