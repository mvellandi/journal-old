While there&#8217;s much to be said about bottled water from a variety of standpoints and perspectives, I like to think of the larger systemic picture at hand. While the one-five gallon offering has been with us since the 80s, it was the mid-90s where the smaller sizes were borne from the marketer&#8217;s mind &#8211; offering the promise of health and convenience. The long term effects on water supplies, trash, and the resulting carbon footprint weren&#8217;t considered. The expansion of the industry led to increased resource strain, in addition to mass cultural acceptance. While I highlighted these [thoughts in a discussion with an Aquafina Brand Manager](../on-bottled-water/) last year, my feelings have turned on the subject a bit toward the critical.

So here&#8217;s a trailer for a documentary called [Tapped](http://www.tappedthemovie.com/) that was released in theaters this summer. Kinda sums up a lot of the issues and feelings at hand, much like [FLOW (For Love of Water)](http://www.flowthefilm.com/) did. What actually excites me though is how it&#8217;s produced by the same folks who did [I.O.U.S.A](http://www.iousathemovie.com/).
