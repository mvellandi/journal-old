Having read Clayton Christensen&#8217;s &#8220;[The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma](http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials/dp/0060521996/)&#8221; and &#8220;[&#8230;Solution](http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Solution-Creating-Sustaining-Successful/dp/1578518520/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b)&#8221; in the last few years, I found the innovation model he presented with historical examples and best practices to be quite useful in understanding markets, innovation cycles, competitiveness, and future scenarios. So I came [across a video](http://www.mondaydots.com/2009/07/disruptive-innovation.html) created by a gentleman named Jeff Monday, who describes the disruptive innovation model with a few additional thoughts of his own. Since he did a fairly good job, I thought I&#8217;d share it here with you.
