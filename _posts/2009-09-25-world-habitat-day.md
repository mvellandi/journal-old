The United Nations has chosen the first Monday in October to be World Habitat Day &#8211; a day to stand up and let it be known that affordable, adequate housing should be a priority everywhere. The theme for the event on October 5th is [&#8220;Planning our Urban Future&#8221;](http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=6966&catid=588&typeid=6&subMenuId=0)
