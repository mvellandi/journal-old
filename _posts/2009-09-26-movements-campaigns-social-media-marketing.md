Neat presentation from Spike Jones of [Brains on Fire](http://www.brainsonfire.com/), on the qualities of movements in social media marketing. While Awareness, Interest, and Action are the traditional steps of an engagement process, it&#8217;s always good to ask how a continual movement is being built and sustained. In my opinion, the campaign is not dead, but rather represents a tactical sub-process of a movement. However, if the movement seems stale or unrealistic to sociological expectations of user interest and engagement levels, campaigns won&#8217;t live up to desired results.

So can Causes be the higher level goal of marketing campaigns at large? It appears many brands that don&#8217;t directly or indirectly improve people&#8217;s lives or foster nature, are at a loss. The next best thing for these organizations then, is to employ social responsibility and communications programs so as to build personal affinity toward the brand. In some industries like logistics, banking, and retail, fostering happy employee cultures and great customer service will be the best forms of marketing because people relate best to people, not to inert and lifeless brands.
