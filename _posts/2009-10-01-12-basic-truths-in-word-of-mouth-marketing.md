Having come across a bookmark I saved with 12 tips on word of mouth marketing by [Andy Sernovitz](http://www.damniwish.com/), I thought it might be a good idea to share them with you:

  1. Happy customers are your best advertising. Make people happy.
  2. Marketing is easy: Earn the respect and recommendation of your customers. They will do your marketing for you, for free.
  3. Ethics and good service come first.
  4. You are the User Experience (not what your advertisements say you are).
  5. Negative word of mouth is an opportunity. Listen and learn.
  6. People are already talking. Your only option is to join the conversation.
  7. Be interesting or be invisible.
  8. If it&#8217;s not worth talking about, it&#8217;s not worth doing.
  9. Make the story of your company a good one.
 10. It is more fun to work at a company that people want to talk about.
 11. Use the power of word of mouth to make business treat people better.
 12. Honest marketing makes more money.

Generalized rules, but good to take to heart. In the social media era, I&#8217;ll add that any opportunities you can design for allowing others to share their opinions with you (feedback/dialogue) or others (tell-a-friend tactics), will be especially useful for both passive and active WOM. However, points 7 and 8 will be two of the most important factors in encouraging conversation.
