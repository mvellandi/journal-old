[IDEO](http://ideo.com) recently built a new web presence with short articles and videos called [Living Climate Change](http://livingclimatechange.com), that describes itself as:

> *&#8220;a place where the most defining challenge of our time is explored through design thinking. Itâ€™s also a place to show, discuss and share compelling and provocative thoughts and ideas about the future&#8230;[the site] invites you to imagine what life will be like in 20 or 30 years, as we move along a path toward reduced carbon emissions. Will the targets be reached? Which behaviors will need to change? Which will we choose to preserve?&#8221;*

Tim Brown relays to us facts about climate change and the necessary social changes that will have to occur through scenario building and design thinking. In my opinion, the site acts as a good way for IDEO to share their thoughts on sustainability in a single-place (domain) without distractions of other aspects of the company.
