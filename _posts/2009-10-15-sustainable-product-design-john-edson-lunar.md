John Edson of [Lunar Design](http://lunar.com) discusses sustainable product design approaches and ideas within the context, in the introduction and ending, of bottled water. I saw John give this presentation live at [Sustainable Brands 09](http://sustainablebrands09.com) and must say that it was refreshing to listen to and experience, given his calm voice and diverse examples provided. Enjoy!
