Tim Leberecht of Frog Design gave a presentation earlier this year at the Next09 conference in Berlin on how societal changes in regards to both the economy and people&#8217;s interactions with each other and brands online are creating a convergence of services offered by the marketing and design agencies, and why &#8220;Meaning&#8221; has become sought after and a key deliverable. The video and slides are available below. See also his [table of 5 attributes of meaning and the mediums/tactics to address them](http://designmind.frogdesign.com/pdf/MeaningfulMarketing.pdf).
