_&#8220;The Dow Chemical Company plans to work with Algenol Biofuels, Inc. to build and operate a pilot-scale algae-based integrated biorefinery that will convert CO2 into ethanol. This is one of many examples that demonstrates Dow&#8217;s commitment to develop new solutions to address the challenges of energy and climate change.&#8221;_

Interesting video by Dow on the innovative activities they&#8217;re pursuing. What I totally love is how they&#8217;re using YouTube as a public relations tool to take their message beyond a lame press release. Well done, although they could have added more tags to the description like algae, ethanol, innovation, and energy.
