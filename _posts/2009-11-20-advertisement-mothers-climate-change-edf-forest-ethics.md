Great and funny ad from the [Environmental Defense Fund Canada](http://www.environmentaldefence.ca/) and [Forest Ethics](http://www.forestethics.org/). Employees of both organizations thought it&#8217;d be great to have their children take part in the video to stress the importance of their future.
