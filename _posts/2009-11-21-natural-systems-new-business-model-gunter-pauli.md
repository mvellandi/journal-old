Founder and Director, <a href="http://www.zeri.org/">Zero Emissions Research Institute</a>, Gunter Pauli gives a great presentation (jump to 25th minute) on how nature can provide us the path to a world where green chemistry doesn&#8217;t just do no harm, but enables radical innovation opportunities; where waste is fed into closed loop systems that maximize social and environmental benefits; and where biomimicry enables us to free ourselves from toxic, complicated current solutions.<br />
