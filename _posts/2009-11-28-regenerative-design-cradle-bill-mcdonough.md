Good &#8216;ole Bill lays down his thoughts on sustainable design from the regenerative school of thought in this one hour lecture. While I&#8217;m quite familiar with it, I thought I&#8217;d share it with you here since it&#8217;s a very inspirational philosophy and view of the world that &#8220;can be&#8221; &#8211; aligned with nature&#8217;s closed-loop systems where waste is equal to food. Although quite alluring, at times the ideas therein can appear lofty, utopian, and impractical precisely because they address systems design at a macro level (although solutions can address the micro as well). What I think you&#8217;ll enjoy though beyond the various examples and inspirational visions he portrays in his slides and stories (as is the case with most of his talks you&#8217;ll find on the web), is his deep philosophical dive into eco-effectiveness (cradle to cradle) versus eco-efficiency.

At the heart of that juxtaposition is the debate over incrementalism versus radical re-design. The right approach to use will always depend on the context though. Bill frames the argument as choosing to be &#8220;less bad&#8221; versus becoming neutral or positive. That can particularly be the case when toxicity is an element of the design situation.

Nonetheless, the principles of regenerative design and closed-loop systems are an essential framework to sustainability &#8211; so I hope you&#8217;ll take away something not only thought-provoking, but also from which you can draw upon in a critical analysis.
