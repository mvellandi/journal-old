Interesting play on green marketing from [CSX Trains](http://www.csx.com/), using air quality and messaging on comparative fuel efficiency from rail freight. In the past, intermodal transport (rail and truck) had been longer delivery times than trucks alone by about 2-4 days, although a logistics friend of mine had said the difference is now 0-2days difference. The important factor is of course total distance (price being equal). In slower economic times, delivery times are less important, so it goes without saying that rail transport should increase if logistics managers and 3rd party schedulers are inclined to use it.

I hope to see more awareness of rail being a preferred &#8220;green&#8221; option.
