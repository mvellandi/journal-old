Neat integrated campaign apparently from TBWA France, that uses creative art to bring about awareness of carbon footprints while asking people to cut back on certain activities. Started earlier this year, the campaign was supposedly spread around to other French offices, but doesn&#8217;t seem to have been taken up by other international agency offices. The potential could have been neat for a major agency, although they&#8217;d probably need to have more employee-generated art, tips, and photos to have REALLY taken off.
