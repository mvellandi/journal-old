Normally I stay away from stories about politics and business. It&#8217;s just not my thing to delve into speculation about collusion and conspiracy. So when IÂ  had picked up John Perkins book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0452287081">Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</a>, it was under my impression that I&#8217;d delve into some wild ride on corporate espionage, theft, bribery, and the like. What I left though with was a unique historical perspective of American modern imperialism and subjugation through international finance and economic development.

John explains his history of becoming an economic hit man &#8211; officially he was an economic adviser &#8211; working for a private firm in the 70s, that saw him travel to Indonesia, Panama, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other countries where he made inflated economic growth predictions and drew up loan proposals to international development banks, upon approval whereby American engineering and construction firms would receive contracts. However, the underlying strategy was to get these countries so far into debt that when they defaulted, concessions were given such as natural resource mining/drilling rights.

What I ended up with was an expanded and critical view of how international development can maliciously be favored toward one country&#8217;s political and business interests. There is no conspiracy, it&#8217;s a systemic problem at a macroeconomic, social, and environmental scale (triple bottom line). In reading the book, one can see parallels in understanding how and why China for example, is now operating in a very similar fashion in Africa.

Sustainability operates on a macro scale as well, which for most of us is quite difficult to comprehend since we work in the limited business and geographic spheres we do. The difference that we can make is continuing to live lighter, consume less, volunteer, and spread the word to others on the benefits of doing so. I&#8217;m an optimist that people and business can be positive change agents abiding by principles of equity and justice.
