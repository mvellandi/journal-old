Christina Wodtke speaks at <a href="http://interaction09.ixda.org/">Interaction 09</a> on defaults, sharing mechanisms, updates, notifications and even SEO as holistic elements of a viral system that is currently driving the popularity of social networks and social media successes everywhere. Over the last three years she&#8217;s been working on understanding social collaborative behavior and viral loops, and asserts that interaction design is key to an applications ability to promote itself.Â  Additionally, she speaks on the underpinnings needed to devise a successful social system as well, touching on identity, reputation, and relationships in digital communities.
