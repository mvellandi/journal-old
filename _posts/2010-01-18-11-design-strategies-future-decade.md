From my Singaporean pal Brian Ling over at [Design Sojourn](http://designsojourn.com), comes a set of design strategies he put together for a presentation. While there are some familiar themes regarding customization, usability, crowdsourcing, and designing to communicate an idea, there are also a few notable ones including Haptic Relationships or &#8220;high-touch electronics&#8221;. I particularly like this strategy because it involves applying usability principles in interfaces conducive to human movement and touch. The Nintendo Wii applied this to gaming in such a way that made total intuitive sense.

I also like using beautiful materials as a strategy. Foremost this is differentiation tactic that when applied to a line, will make it premium. Applied to an entire brand, it&#8217;s also likely to become premium in comparison to other brands, although I don&#8217;t necessarily think it has to be. What we&#8217;re talking about is standing out and looking great &#8211; no matter the material cost. Apple notebooks are either white plastic or matte aluminum. Nothing too fancy there, but they sure stand out!

Do you have a favorite strategy or one to add?
