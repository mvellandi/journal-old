From the [Nokia Conversations blog](http://conversations.nokia.com/2010/01/22/nokia-in-beijing-sustainability-begins-in-the-back-yard/), comes this great piece of creative that tells the company&#8217;s sustainability story in Beijing. The film style has a journalistic feel to it; for some reason to me, reminiscent of the BBC. If Nokia were to make similar videos throughout its global operations, it could have a nice library of stories that communicate the values of its brand.

This type of storytelling is what we call in German &#8220;die Oberfläche&#8221;, and is meant as a gentle snapshot of a company&#8217;s operations without much detail. For reporting purposes, it serves as an excellent tool when looking closer at specific markets (in this case). For an extreme example of video reporting done well on a budget, see this HKBN CSR Report.
