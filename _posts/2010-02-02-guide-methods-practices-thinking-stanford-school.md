[As quoted from their blog:](http://dschool.typepad.com/news/2009/12/the-bootcamp-bootleg-is-here.html)

> *The Bootcamp Bootleg is intended for people who&#8217;ve already had an introduction to design thinking, but who need some refreshers as they head out to tackle real-world challenges. The teaching team curated the collection by leveraging the work of many predecessors, drawing from material developed by d.school teaching teams and folks throughout the design world over the last five years.*
