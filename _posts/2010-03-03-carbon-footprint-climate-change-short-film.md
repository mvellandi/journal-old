Neat short film I found from Germany that discusses carbon footprints. The original description says, &#8220;One of the three winners of the Germanwatch screenplay competition about Climate Justice. In this four-minute movie produced by Peter Wedel the CO2 intensive lifestyle of an urban dweller (played by Benno FÃ¼rmann) is put in contrast to the people in developing countries which are affected most by Climate Change.
