I attended this presentation by Elizabeth Grossman, regarding her story in writing the book **[Chasing Molecules: Poisonous Products, Human Health, and the Promise of Green Ghemistry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597263702?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1597263702)**. It&#8217;s a fantastic story that&#8217;s kind of scary on one side, but enlightening and inspirational on the other. When we consider chemicals that were engineered in the last 100 years, the primary focus was on performance, but little (if any) thought was given toward persistent toxicity throughout lifecycles and their biological impacts.

While I could go on, let Elizabeth walk you through the journey she took and learnings along the way. Enjoyez!
