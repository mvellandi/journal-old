A few weeks ago, an old friend of mine asked me about my title of &#8220;Digital PR Strategist&#8221; and what that entails. I&#8217;d like to share my response and ask for your thoughts or additions.

A digital public relations strategist devises a plan and set of activities to:

  * Position a brand&#8217;s identity and establish a desired public image online
  * Monitor online dialogue (volume, who&#8217;s talking, sentiment) about the brand, competitors, and general trends
  * Engage with the public, mavens, bloggers/writers, and connectors on shared interests, questions/concerns, brand information
  * Create remarkable (comment- or shareworthy) content online (text, photos, multimedia)
  * Promote valuable product offerings, campaigns, or brand identity topics with these audiences
  * Influence positive word of mouth online to&#8230;
  * Drive actions (website visits, newsletter signups, donations, purchases&#8230;)
  * Measure and Maintain desired performance (campaign or the brand at large)

I&#8217;ve considered adding something regarding SEO, since this is important for digital marketing, findability, and reputation management.

**What are your thoughts?**
