My interview with Shivani Siroya of InVenture.org, at the [Ideation 10 Conference](http://www.ideationconference.com/). Shivani&#8217;s organization provides micro-venture capital so entrepreneurs have an opportunity for real financial and social growth, and they&#8217;ll lift not just themselves, but also their communities out of poverty.

InVenture raises capital largely through its online platform, where InVestors can choose from several different funds and network with other like-minded individuals to increase their impact. As soon as the business begins turning a profit, a portion of that profit is reinvested in the community. Business reinvestment in social initiatives, such as clean water and education, improves the livelihood of the community as a whole. And the stronger the community, the greater the chance that other businesses can succeed.
