We may finally be on the verge of a tipping point wherein mainstream attention to identifying and mitigating a companyâ€™s carbon impact will become a core strategic priority for all businesses. But what comes next? The reality is, global warming is just one of the detrimental impacts of unchecked business activity. During this time of seismic shift in awareness of the interconnectedness of things, the opportunity is to take a longer, more systemic view of the many ways our activities impact the world around us. By doing so, we will begin to anticipate and respond more quickly to both the needs and the enormous world of possibility in front of us to innovate for a whole, healed world. Listen to [Mathis Wackernagel](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/mathis_wackernagel) of [Global Footprint Network](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/), who is working with leaders around the globe to help us all understand and ultimately align our activities with the basic carrying capacity of the earth.
