[Owen Rogers](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/owen_rogers) is one of the senior executives at [IDEO](http://ideo.com), a leading international design firm where he is the partner in charge of the consumer experience design. Owen spends much of his time designing sustainability into his client work. In his [Sustainable Brands ‘09](http://sustainablebrands09.com) opening remarks, Owen talks about how the sustainable design evolution is happening all over the globe, and poses and interesting question &#8212; one that stirred debate throughout the conference and beyond. What if sustainability were considered, and treated as a brand in and of itself? The premise for this correlation is that passion is a driving element of both brands, and the sustainability movement. He also gives examples of companies humanizing their brand and stirring up emotion, like Comcast and Honda as shown in a few television advertisements.
