Plastiki’s Expedition Leader David De Rothschild takes some time to speak with my colleague Lindsey Whited about the impact that his voyage will make in the world of corporate responsibility and why companies should stay curious and challenge themselves regularly on the path to sustainability. The sailboat is made from bottles collected from Waste Management in San Francisco.
