When I heard about this story that came up about a month ago &#8211; The [Clorox company](http://www.thecloroxcompany.com/) sending [Method Products](http://www.methodhome.com/) a cease and desist letter over the use of daisies in brand marketing &#8211; I seriously had to laugh. Listen to David humorously stand his position against Goliath.
