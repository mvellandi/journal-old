The Breakup Letter is a design research tool that [Smart Design](http://www.smartdesignworldwide.com/) uses to understand the emotional connection between people and their products, services, and experiences.Â  At [IIT&#8217;s 2010 Design Research Conference](http://www.designresearchconference.org/), Smart Design asked participants of their Sex Ed workshop to test out this tool by writing and reciting a Breakup Letter. Each participant took 15 minutes to write a letter and then shared their stories of finally moving on.
