Having met the founder Scott Harrison at a nonprofit conference in April, I was blown away by the creative power of his org&#8217;s message and storytelling. In 2009, they were able to procure usage rights for the song &#8220;Timebomb&#8221; by Beck &#8211; months before the corresponding album release date. It&#8217;s this kind of visual creative that is what great cause activism (business or nonprofit) is all about. Draw people in with great content that is entertaining, providing proof of concept, and not just tug on peoples emotions and make them feel sorry about the state of the world (social, environmental). Inspirational for my future work in integrated marketing. Check out their [whole video library online.](http://vimeo.com/charitywater/videos)
