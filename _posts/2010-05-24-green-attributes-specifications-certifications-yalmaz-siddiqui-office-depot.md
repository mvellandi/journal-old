Yalmaz Siddiqui, Director of Environmental Strategy at [Office Depot](http://www.officedepot.com/), discusses environmental product attributes, shades of green, and their approach to making business/organizational procurement easier. Listen as Yalmaz describes how they&#8217;ve placed consideration to single and multi-attribute certifications, determined to mix them among their own internally valued product characteristics, and establish three shades of green labeling among different attributes, each with uniquely designed icons. Provides an excellent case study and proposition for why assessing the landscape and going your own creative, authentic way to meet your customers&#8217; procurement needs, can be the right thing for a retailer to do.
