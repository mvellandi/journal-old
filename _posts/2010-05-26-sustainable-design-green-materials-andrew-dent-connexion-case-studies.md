Business Week Innovation Columnist and Materials Scientist [Andrew Dent](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/andrew_dent) of [Material Connexion](http://www.materialconnexion.com/), discusses why intelligent and cost-effective sustainability has become increasingly important, particularly as consumers grow weary of being bombarded with “green” solutions of questionable validity. He&#8217;ll provide some guiding examples of how to approach a new &#8216;good design&#8217; ethos, as well as a look at innovative new materials, the present state of recycled materials and polymers, BPA, PFOA, formaldehyde, and ways to ensure compliance with current and future bans on certain chemicals. He also feature case studies from a wide range of industries, including packaging, sneaker design, medical and consumer products, and electronics and housewares.
