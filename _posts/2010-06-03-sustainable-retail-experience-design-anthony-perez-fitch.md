Retail is the conduit between manufacturers and consumers, and presents a frontline opportunity for messaging, product selection, and an environment that focuses on being better. In a holistic sense for both the shopper and the retailer and their operations. There&#8217;s much psychology through going on behind the scenes, in not only trying to understand and meet shoppers needs, but also by delighting them. [Stephanie Eller](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/stephanie_eller) and [Anthony Perez](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/stephanie_eller) of [FITCH](http://www.fitch.com/), specialize in research and design initiatives for various retailers regarding these areas, and present here a variety of findings and case studies on sustainability, retail, shopper attitudes and behaviors, and brands that are providing custom atmospheres and experiences that stand out.
