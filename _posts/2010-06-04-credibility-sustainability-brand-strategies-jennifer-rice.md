[Jennifer Rice](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/jennifer_rice) of [Fruitful Strategy](http://www.fruitfulstrategy.com/) reviews key considerations in building credibility, from mitigating risk to driving revenue. She’ll present a range of credibility-building ideas such as how to leverage brand strategy options, customer experience design, certifications, and more. This session will help you answer the following questions: \* What is credibility, and why is it important? \* How can you zero in on the customer segments and other stakeholders who&#8217;s influence matters most? \* How to tease out which dimensions of sustainability matter to them, and whether they will give you “permission to play” in sustainability-related offerings? \* Top ten strategies to building credibility, including new offerings, certifications, ingredient or initiative-based brand plays, enriching your customer&#8217;s experience, and more.
