[Mike Barry](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/mike_barry), Head of Sustainable Retail at [Marks & Spencer](http://www.marksandspencer.com/) discusses their corporate responsibility initiative, [Plan A](http://plana.marksandspencer.com/), and addresses common challenges and wins for retailers who are on a path toward better business. From food, clothing, energy efficiency, carbon miles, fair trade, and more&#8230;the number of areas to address as part of a holistic sustainable retail operation and customer engagement plan is large.

While unfortunately there&#8217;s no slides to this video, Mike is very sharp and to the point. Worth listening to as a podcast 🙂
