Blair Shane, Chief Marketing Officer of the new [California Academy of Sciences](http://www.calacademy.org/), discusses how a 150 year old institution dedicated to nature took on the challenge of reinvention for a new generation. Blair covers all aspects of creating a durable, sustainable brand: environmental, financial, new audience development and customer experience. Hear how the 4th R &#8211; Reinvention is as critical as the traditional three – reuse, renew and recycle and how the Academy is using it to move from surviving, to thriving &#8211; through innovation and creative marketing.

The building design was an inspirational story, but my favorite aspects were the integrated multi-channel marketing approach. The digital work seemed pretty good too. Seriously, you have to check out the &#8220;green roof&#8221; that they made at a few bus shelters. Bringing in younger audiences to the museum by having cocktails and djs was another good idea, one that I&#8217;m familiar with from the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
