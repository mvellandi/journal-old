Former Seventh Generation CMO and Nike brand catalyst [Duke Stump](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/duke_stump) helps us capture the essence of sustainability through a wider lens. Expect an inspiring narrative informed by key principles that speak to a new breed of businesses and behavior, known as Bonfire brands. Includes inspiration from [Buckminster Fuller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) and [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com). Marketing and the essence of a company has to be authentic to its very soul, in order for it to transcend sameness.
