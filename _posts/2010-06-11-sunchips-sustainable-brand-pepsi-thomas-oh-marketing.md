In 2007, [SunChips](http://www.sunchips.com/) was successfully repositioned as a snack brand that is better for you and better for the planet. This presentation by Chief Marketing Officer [Thomas Oh](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/thomas_oh), will highlight the motivation and strategy surrounding this decision, and the resulting brand innovation and marketing initiatives that were launched to both build and communicate the brand&#8217;s authentic steps towards becoming the preeminent sustainable snack. Includes the history of SunChips, various advertising and cause marketing campaign videos and creative print ads, and the story behind the [compostable bag](../sunchips-compostable-bag-pla-pepsico-frito-lay/). But more than that, it&#8217;s about a holistic, integrated brand identity and its communications strategy.
