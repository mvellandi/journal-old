Yahoo!’s audience of hundreds of millions of consumers provides a rich data set for understanding what consumers are responding to online today, and how this is shifting over time. A recently completed 5-month study, reveals significant insight into the kinds of green content people are responding to most. [Erin Carlson](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/erin_carlson), Director of [Yahoo! for Good](http://forgood.yahoo.com/), discusses what types of story and advertising messaging, tone and voice resonate with different types of consumers. Interestingly, not only does it depend on who you&#8217;re talking to, but also what type of product you’re advertising. It&#8217;s all about progressing to an enlightened and audience-engaging form of communication, that&#8217;s meant to go beyond the yesteryear cliches of subjective, save-the-planet ideas which make people feel hopeful or warm/bad inside.
