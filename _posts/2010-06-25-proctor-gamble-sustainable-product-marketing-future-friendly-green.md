Not sure how I let this slip my green marketing radar for so long (probably work related), though Proctor & Gamble&#8217;s new approach to marketing sustainability in its products is admirable. Placing the messaging focus on care for the future, instead of care for the planet, they&#8217;re fostering greater resonance by being more subjective & encompassing in their values branding. Now of course, I&#8217;m referring to the super majority of public brand experiences, in a store and having seen the label. The animation below after all, is for PR purposes.

Which brings us to the label. At quick glance is the bold condensed type, if someone does look closer and see the water, electricity, and trash icons, they might make the second connection. Not quite being an artist but having experience in visualizing information, I appreciate it when good design can quickly convey meaning & values, as I can be quite the cynic in believing that most people don&#8217;t like to read anything more than headlines (it&#8217;s a time & effort factor).

All in all, I think it&#8217;s a great effort that generates greater awareness of manufacturer responsibility & care, than other self-declaration labels like [SC Johnson&#8217;s Greenlist](http://www.scjohnson.com/en/press-room/fact-sheets/09-10-2009/Greenlist-Fact-Sheet.aspx). If we&#8217;re trying to grab attention and help people quickly make better choices, P&G&#8217;s approach seems quite effective.
