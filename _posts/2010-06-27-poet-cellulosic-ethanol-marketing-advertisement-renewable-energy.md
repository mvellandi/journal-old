If you didn&#8217;t know, [POET](http://poet.com/) is the leading biofuel production company in the US. So to see their ads recently in prime time television on CNN, was refreshing not only for the opportunity of greater public awareness of homegrown alternative energy opportunities, but also for the creative direction they took. The small but proud voice in a sea of bustle and movement. The voice of the enthusiastic engineer, the pragmatic plant manager, and the ferverous farmer (I tried to find a corresponding &#8220;f&#8221; adjective for the noun, but to creative disavail).
