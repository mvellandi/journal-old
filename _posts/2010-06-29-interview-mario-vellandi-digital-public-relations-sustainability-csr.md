Yes sir, that&#8217;s me in the interviewee seat with Kevin Long of JustMeans at Sustainable Brands 10. Kevin had caught me at a tired moment, but there was no way I was going to let him out energize me, out passion&#8221;ate&#8221; me, or give him the upper hand (wink).

In addition to my staunch and honest advice for organizations to JFDI (just focus/f\***in do it) in regards to social media, I added an important point marketers and sustainability practitioners ought to know. While active engagement is sexy (and scary for some), listening and monitoring is very important, and should be the starting point for any greenfield or beginning stages. Just like in life. Lots of insights can be gleaned&#8230;
