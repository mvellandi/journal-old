So one of my favorite marketers, [Tim Leberecht](http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/author/elektroniker/), put together a slidedeck on 7 rules for the Chief Meaning Officer. Now if you&#8217;ve been following me along for a while, you&#8217;ve seen how much of a social media, branding, innovation, and sustainability/ethics aficionado I am. Thus in going through Tim&#8217;s slides, there will be many points that have been expounded upon many a times by marketers. However, I&#8217;d really like to stress the term &#8220;meaning&#8221;. Yes it carries a largely amount of weight for personal &#8220;value&#8221; and benefits. Fewer marketers have extolled the virtues of transcending utilitarian benefits, into the actualization realm. Those with a love for &#8220;social&#8221; will advocate the human connectedness factors that digital marketing & conversations provide about life, love/pain, &#8220;insert topic here&#8221;, and of course the brand and user-experience.

All those things are great, but for me brand love & loyalty for a higher purpose beyond ourselves is where real magic is. Beyond the &#8220;I love Apple, Disney, Anthropologie, Target, Method, other passion brand&#8221; experience. There are so many different brand personalities out there that are admired or liked in their own way. In my B2B experience, oftentimes it&#8217;s the culture and how the brand interactions at various touchpoints are simply pleasant, despite the nature of the product/service being a bit boring.

Off to Tim&#8217;s presentation! Enjoy. Don&#8217;t let it overwhelm you though; go through the slides at a slow pace ðŸ™‚
