Great (older) video from [Charity Water&#8217;s](http://www.charitywater.org/) Scott Harrison that uses the power of founder-narrated storytelling to describe the history and mission of an organization. To me, it&#8217;s a style of marketing I call Cause Championing combined with brand identity. For nonprofit organizations, this is likely to be one and the same (though I&#8217;ll save that conversation for a future time). Enjoyez!
