From the [Sustainability Consortium](http://www.sustainabilityconsortium.org/) comes this animation about their organizational mission in bringing together brands and academics to collectively pursue better product manufacturing through a shared life-cycle assessment and materials database. Creatively speaking, I thought the content style in the beginning was a little trite, though it got better as the story unraveled and must say that animations can really help make complex topics concrete.
