Neat presentation from [Erin Malone](http://www.emdezine.com/) on what she sees as three trends in information architecture. Blend that term with interaction design, user experience, social behavior, and psychology to get the bigger picture (since IA is somewhat of a boring subject in itself). See her [article for the thoughts behind the slides](http://www.emdezine.com/deziningInteractions/2010/05/14/the-future-is-already-here-three-trends-in-ia/).
