Fun presentation and collection of thoughts from Frog Design&#8217;s David Sherwin and Justin Maguire on the required attitude and traits for innovative leaders. I agree with much of it. I&#8217;ll stress a desire to see the big picture from a balanced perspective, the willingness to step forward and say &#8220;We can do better!&#8221;, the desire and aptitude to foster ideation with a diverse team, active listening skills, and doggedness to pursue and actualize a vision.
