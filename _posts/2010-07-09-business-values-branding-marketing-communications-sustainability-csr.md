A few months ago, I was sitting in a BJ&#8217;s restaurant with my big spiral notebook, a good Hefeweizen, and a swarm of thoughts on branding for good. In the last 3 years, I&#8217;d realized through observation, experience, and enough books and articles on the subject, that branding really is what people experience in their interactions with an organization, and their subsequent perceptions. Sometimes actively, sometimes passively, sometimes directly, sometimes by association. In every touchpoint, including media and word of mouth.

<a href="../images/2010/bvm.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-4616 aligncenter" title="business values communications map" src="/images/2010/bvm-1024x662.png" alt="business values communications diagram" width="700" height="451" /></a>Given that reality, what does this entail for values branding? Without going into the specifics of values (as every business&#8217;s personality, objectives, value proposition, culture, and industry is different), I started to look at the big picture of which functions branding performs and came up with the following meta model. Since all actions also entail a degree of communication, I then categorized the tactics and tools available for development, interaction options, distribution, and measurement. Hope you enjoy it!
