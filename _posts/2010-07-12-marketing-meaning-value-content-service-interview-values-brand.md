From one of my new favorite marketers, [Bob Gilbreath](http://www.marketingwithmeaning.com/) talks about the current state of marketing, having transitioned from advertising to permission marketing, to what is espoused by some (gleefully including ME!) to be a higher order level. One that fulls human needs and desires beyond function & emotion. Without wanting to dive in the subjective zone, just consider products & services that helped you achieve something meaningful and valuable, but which was either free or low-cost (perhaps &#8220;at cost&#8221;). Something you weren&#8217;t directly looking for, but stumbled upon or told about, and found valuable. The brand interaction might have been very minimal, but nonetheless there was a small or large degree of affinity or appreciation for what you received and are/were able to achieve. Concrete examples include free cookbooks (pamphlets or digital), white papers and multimedia presentations, a public restroom in Times Square NYC courtesy of Charmin quilted toiletpaper. Let your imagination soar with this one; just remember the principles of subtlety in your brand marketing &#8211; otherwise it&#8217;s just a promotional gimmick. I&#8217;ll be writing more on this topic in months to come. In the meantime, enjoy this video interview! P.S. &#8211; I have my own interview with Bob to put online soon ðŸ™‚
