I recently stumbled upon this video produced by [BusinessLink.gov.uk](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk) as a story about the CSR efforts of an English architecture firm, primarily as it relates to the benefits of having established volunteerism and employee happiness programs (among other areas). So while this wasn&#8217;t produced by [Bailey Partnership](http://www.baileypartnership.co.uk/), it serves as an amazing 5min introduction to a humanistic aspect of the company and its employees. Now, if I were in charge of brand identity of a company I&#8217;d do a couple things: 1) Keep any brochures very straightforward and concise with a maximum of 5 subjects; 2) Produce videos on the identified subjects along with sustainability/csr, but create each as a collection of clips, from which older clips can reused or discarded, and newer clips can be added. The entire production would be inline with an integrated brand communications platform for identity purposes, which could especially be useful for existing and potential stakeholders (equity holders, partners, and employees).

Okay, on with the show! Could such a 5min video be helpful for your firm?

Another example I provided a while back, has more of a reporting than a journalistic feel.
