Wayne Visser is a longtime consultant in CSR and had made a pretty good, and short 13 slide presentation on how the practice needs to change. He advocates abandoning the old limited scope of CSR, and adopting the modern, holistic, and proactive Corporate Sustainability & Responsibility. Sounds good to me. Since my career wasn&#8217;t in the original field, I&#8217;m automatically biased to think that bigger systemic thinking & action is the right framework. From a management perspective, it just makes sense to hold a bigger mental model of what [sustainability and values branding mean](../business-values-branding-marketing-communications-sustainability-csr/) for a company.
