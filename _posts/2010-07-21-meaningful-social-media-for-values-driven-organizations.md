Just finished up a new graphic to shed some light on a perpetual 4 step process of meaningful marketing:

A macro perspective map of four activity sets that should be run concurrently for meaningful social media to gain traction and move forward, for both single and multiple projects. Given that the upperleft quadrant first highlights content production, one can assume this is a content production and interaction model (for which it would be great), but you can perceive it any way you want 🙂

Sometimes it&#8217;s only necessary to participate in one activity set, based on a project&#8217;s short scope. However, most of these four activities need to be undertaken at some point.
