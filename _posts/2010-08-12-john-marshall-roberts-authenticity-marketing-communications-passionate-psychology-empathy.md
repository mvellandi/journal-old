While it may be easy to attract the attention of a growing cross section of consumers with your social or environmental brand messaging â€“ if you know the right language, not all consumers are so easy. Drawing from his book &#8220;[Igniting Inspiration: A Persuasion Manual for Visionaries](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419654837?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1419654837)&#8220;, John Marshall Roberts outlines core principles of transformational communication, as illustrated through the groundbreaking marketing and messaging for President Obama&#8217;s historic presidential run. He illustrates how the audience can shift their thinking and apply this same framework to create breakthrough results for their own social and environmentally conscious business ventures through strategic, authentic values-based marketing and communications.

Crazy, energetic speaker with great ideas. His latest presentation from Sustainable Brands 10 (which I hope to show sometime this Fall), dives further into what I think of as radical emotional intelligence for communication design, for good ðŸ˜‰
