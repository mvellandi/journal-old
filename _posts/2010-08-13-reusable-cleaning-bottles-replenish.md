Real sustainability can best be achieved by creating better-made products designed to be re-used as well as recycled. [Replenish](http://www.myreplenish.com)â€™s flagship product, available later this year, is an eco-friendly, multi-surface household cleaner in a reusable bottle that makes concentrates easier to use, is safer for the environment and saves money for consumers and retailers.

I met the engineer/founder Jason Foster earlier this year at Sustainable Brands 10, where I also did a video interview. The bottle works and the refills look like a Glade (brand) cartridge. Self-explanatory, no? Don&#8217;t ship water, buy only what you need, everyone reduces affiliated carbon emissions from weight reduction.
