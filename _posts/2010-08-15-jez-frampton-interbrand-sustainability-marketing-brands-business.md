The social demands of the new marketplace are clear: be ethical and responsible. [Global CEO Jez Frampton](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/jez_frampton) of [Interbrand](http://www.interbrand.com/), discusses sustainability&#8217;s place on the business agenda, but notes that few brands are notable leaders and that only a small minority of employees feel prepared to take the issue head on. CSR and corporate responsibility for the most part haven&#8217;t resonated because marketing and basic identity communications superceded substantive change, progress, or radical product/service development. In addition to various research findings, Jez speaks on the role of brands and their strength as the key elements of value, and how they do have the power to do great things. Sometimes change the world in both small and bigger ways. Outlining principles from stories like Tom&#8217;s Shoes, Method, Aveda, Nokia, 3M, and Xerox, he goes on to give 3 steps for brands going forward.
