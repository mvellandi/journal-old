[Timberland](http://www.timberland.com/)&#8216;s Chief Marketing Officer, [Mike Harrison](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/mike_harrison), speaks in an interview with me on topics including: social media, brand stories and content that resonates with customers, what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Additionally, Mike explains how [Earthkeepers](http://earthkeeper.com/) isn&#8217;t just a shoe, but also a brand platform for authentic and credible communications with stakeholders and the public on Timberland&#8217;s corporate responsibility commitment and environmental stewardship efforts, and what they care about as a company. A human relationship with the great outdoors based on respect, love, and adventure.
