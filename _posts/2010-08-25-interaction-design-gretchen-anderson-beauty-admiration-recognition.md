Why are faces so special? Because while some may be lovely and others unsightly, we do recognize them instantly. Like seeing faces in abstract art, nature, and space photographs of the moon. They&#8217;re an apt metaphor for the near instantly perceived elements of a design that we can interact, perhaps delightfully notice and want to play with (well, isn&#8217;t that every designer&#8217;s hope?!)

Gretchen Anderson takes us on journey through this topic, because it&#8217;s an important one that deserves attention. Not for usability sake, while that is a noble goal in itself, but for attraction sake. That which naturally invites people into the experience you&#8217;ve designed. While perhaps physical form design may be the easiest to conjure up, it also extends to graphic and information design.
