[John Viera](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/john_viera) who leads Ford Motor Company&#8217;s sustainable business strategies, speaks with me at Sustainable Brands 10 about their near, medium, and long term sustainability plans for vehicle engineering & design. Topics include eco-boost technology which use fewer cylinders in the internal combustion engine to achieve similar horsepower while using less gas; alternative fuel engines that accept ethanol, propane, and natural gas; hybrid & electric drivetrains; recycled and biobased soy materials procurement; and lightweighting.
