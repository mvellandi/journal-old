Replenish is a fantastically innovative household cleaning product, not based on some new magical formula, but rather the bottle&#8217;s design. Founder Jason Foster explains in an interview with me about the story behind the bottle, and how its continuous reuse through easy-to-use pod at the bottom, saves people money, waste, and the planet from associated carbon emissions by shipping water. An elegant and intuitive solution indeed! Learn more at [http://www.myreplenish.com](http://www.myreplenish.com)
