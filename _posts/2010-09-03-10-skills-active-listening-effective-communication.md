From the book (link to publisher&#8217;s Flickr set), [Storytelling for User Experience](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/sets/72157623684098940/with/4459211839/), comes this neat chart of activities and skills for active listening. While it isn&#8217;t my own work, it&#8217;s a lot easier to just embed the table. Enjoy!
