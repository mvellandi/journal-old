In 2007, UK retailer [Marks and Spencer](http://www.marksandspencer.com/) embarked on an industry leading, five-year, [100-point &#8216;eco&#8217; plan](http://plana.marksandspencer.com/) to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing business and our world. They have made enormous progress on their 5 core goals: Become carbon neutral, send no waste to landfill, extend sustainable sourcing, help improve the lives of people in their supply chain and help customers and employees live a healthier lifestyle. Listen to Marks and Spencer&#8217;s Head of Sustainable Business, Mike Barry, who shares some of the exemplary work they’ve done to communicate their efforts to their customers and engage them in the success of Plan A, as well as discuss how these efforts are helping create deeper brand affinity.
