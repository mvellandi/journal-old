Designing innovative and sustainable business models requires examining the various components of an organization&#8217;s operations, customers, and value proposition. [Alexander Osterwalder](http://alexosterwalder.com/) is the co-author of the book [Business Model Generation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470876417?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470876417), and in this interview with me discusses how he helps companies along this path, the similarities and differences between BMG and [Blue Ocean Strategy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591396190?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591396190), how social entrepreneurs are tackling difficult challenges as opposed to nonprofits, and the value of visualizing ideas in group discussions.
