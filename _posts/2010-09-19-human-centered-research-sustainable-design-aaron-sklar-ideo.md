Human-centered design and empathy is the foundation for IDEO&#8217;s work, as [Aaron Sklar](http://sustainablelifemedia.com/innovator/aaron_sklar) explains. Change Plus is the program he works on, which seeks to understand people&#8217;s lives so as to design products & services which modify their behavior in positive ways. Additionally, Aaron discusses his hopes for the future of research and design for good, and a unique 2-year project in India and Kenya called the &#8220;Ripple Effect&#8221;, which studied how people obtain and store clean drinking water.
