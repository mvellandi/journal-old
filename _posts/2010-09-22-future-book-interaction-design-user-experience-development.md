First off, check out the video below for the neat ideas on book reading/sharing experiences by IDEO

Now as much as I like technology, I must say  there is a remarkable beauty in focus and minimalism, as it allows people to immerse themselves into the experience they&#8217;re having more fully. Whatever additional interaction and information design options we add to what&#8217;s supposed to already be an enjoyable activity, the more we are potentially capable of distracting the user and inhibiting their full experience.

Just because an additional interaction is possible, does not mean it should necessarily be designed in as an auxiliary experience. In product development, we must question all features for their usefulness and value to the user, in addition to the marginal cost it will add to production and retail price. I say that in digital products and services, if the feature is novel&#8230;dump it! You&#8217;ll just increase the time-to-market, development costs, and payback period (as a result of delayed cash inflows).

For one great perspective on this subject, read [Google&#8217;s 10 User Experience Principles](http://www.google.com/corporate/ux.html)

But don&#8217;t let that necessarily from experimenting with some really awesome ideas! In the context of a book though, we have a couple of challenges. To meet such a product concept, we&#8217;d need to have a more powerful version of PDF that can dynamically call and display data, just like HTML + AJAX. Perhaps it could call upon APIs. Perhaps it&#8217;s all simply an iPad (or compatible) application 🙂
