Bringing ethics, values, and sustainability to fashion design is Summer Rayne Oakes passion. Listen as she speaks with me on her journey in sustainability in the clothing & garment industry, and what inspired her to create [Source4Style](http://source4style.com/S4/) with its mission of helping designers search, compare, and purchase more sustainable materials from a global network of suppliers. As she explains, the current situation makes designers work backwards because they either can&#8217;t find the material, or it&#8217;s cost prohibitive. Lastly, Summer Rayne discusses what she sees as the future of sustainable fashion brands, and the role that independent designers will play.
