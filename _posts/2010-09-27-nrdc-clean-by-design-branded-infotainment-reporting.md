Okay, so while the [NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council)](http://www.nrdc.org/) segment has merit to watch, I&#8217;d like to draw attention to the format itself. A short piece that explains the current situation of eco/ethical fashion, polluting and energy inefficient textile mills in China, the negative externalities traveling across the Pacific to America, and what they&#8217;re finding and doing as an organization.

Amazing! Lots of footage, multimedia, animations and info keep the viewer tuned in. However, surely I must offer some critique ðŸ™‚ although I&#8217;m no professional director:

  * There&#8217;s almost too much information. Or maybe there&#8217;s too much animation. As a reporting piece, it&#8217;s a little hard to cognitively hold the information and sense the gravity or implications thereof. It&#8217;s almost as the sense of &#8220;play&#8221; and visual stimulation deter from making the concise story stick. I&#8217;m not necessarily asking that it be as simple as a [CBS 60minutes segment](http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/60minutes/main3415.shtml), but one does have to appreciate the maintained focus that such tried and true news reporting formats have on the &#8220;viewer experience&#8221;.
  
  * Use narrators that will look and speak well behind the camera. It was the lady&#8217;s half-asleep looking eyes that contradicted the intended feeling of eye-opening facts being presented in the background. Occasionally zooming in on her face did no justice at all.

Inspirational creative to say the least though!
