As part of P&G’s strategy to grow responsibly, their sustainability plan aims toward:

  * Powering its plants with 100% renewable energy
  * Using 100% renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging
  * Having zero consumer and manufacturing waste go to landfills
  * Designing products that delight consumers while maximizing the conservation of resources

**Opinion:** Their video press release was neat! But its feel was polished and a bit sterile, never mind the downtempo electronic music and retro color manipulation. The tagline at the end was definitely a classic ad technique &#8211; &#8220;Let&#8217;s throw a little brand messaging in there! Their public relations department is gonna love it. High fives everyone&#8221;.

Blah! Maybe I&#8217;m being harsh; if it was bad it wouldn&#8217;t have been approved. It&#8217;s just that for announcements in regards to corporate responsibility, I prefer humility and authenticity. This production just seemed to try too hard. The part where Len goes out to look out over the Cincinnati river in reflection &#8211; so heart warming. If he had spoken a bit more in the first person, that scene might have better resonated as the spokesperson for a (hopefully) viewer-perceived caring family brand.
