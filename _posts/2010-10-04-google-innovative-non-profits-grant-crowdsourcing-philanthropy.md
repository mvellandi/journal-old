Called [Project Ten To the One Hundred](http://www.project10tothe100.com/) (10^100) the program synthesized ideas submitted by thousands and submitted the top sixteen programs to public vote.  Google’s team then selected the top 5 non-profits to receive the $10 million.  Here are the winners:

  * **[The Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org/)**:  Received $2 million, the non-profit creates YouTube videos for the vast majority of subject matters regularly taught from primary to secondary school, allowing any student with a computer and internet access to have a complete education, for free.
  * [**FIRST**](http://www.usfirst.org/): As mentioned in the [previous blog post about Change The Equation](http://www.causeintegration.com/2010/changing-the-equation-on-americas-approach-to-science-education/), FIRST inspires students to be science and math leaders through hands-on experience working with professional scientists and engineers.  Google is donating $3 million towards student-driven robotics teams.
  * [**Public.Resource.org**](http://public.resource.org/) received $2 million to make government legal materials in the US available to all online.
  * [**Schweeb**](http://shweeb.com/) provides a short-distance, human-powered monorail.  They received $1 million to test a pilot in an urban environment.
  * The [African Institute For Mathematical Science (AIMS)](http://www.aims.ac.za/) received $2 million to open additional AIMS centers across South Africa to assist college graduates in a bridge year to prepare them for graduate and doctoral programs.

**Opinion:** I find it pretty neat to crowdsource ideas for a company&#8217;s philanthropic efforts. But I must say that having a company&#8217;s employees submit ideas is a LOT better and relevant than asking the public. While it may be up to individual interpretation, employees run a company. Therefore asking the public is practically just publicity and marketing. Which isn&#8217;t necessarily bad when we consider the Pepsi Refresh project.

The video absolutely kicks ass! Authentic, fun, and text animation made the ideas very quickly concrete as some information is best presented as text to be quickly read and processed, rather than heard.
