Great creative design on this campaign video from [Anvil Knitwear](http://www.anvilknitwear.com/) that serves to educate on the pollution and wildlife health problem that pesticides can wreak, followed by messaging that basically says while we&#8217;re to blame, we can make a difference, that organic is the way, and this movement can bring about lots of positive benefits.

I must say though that the first part of the message is very negative and makes &#8220;you&#8221; feel bad. As if the video is talking literally to you, although the intent is that Earth is talking to us as a human race. Secondly, so-called facts are tossed around like propaganda and claims of high toxicity and death-inducement possibility is a bit over the top. Maybe such things are true in cases, but does the fear message need to be so pronounced? Granted it is a campaign video. Sometimes I just wish messaging could be a bit more objective and focused so that some viewers won&#8217;t necessarily be turned off and tune out. Metrics and testing can help in such cases for communication design.

Nonetheless, the creative is great.
