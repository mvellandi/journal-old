As quoted from the video description:

> *&#8220;Beginning with Charles Darwin&#8217;s first encounter with the teeming ecosystem of the coral reef and drawing connections to the intellectual hyperproductivity of modern megacities and to the instant success of YouTube, Johnson shows us that the question we need to ask is, What kind of environment fosters the development of good ideas? His answers are never less than revelatory, convincing, and inspiring as Johnson identifies the seven key principles to the genesis of such ideas, and traces them across time and disciplines.*
>
> *Most exhilarating is Johnson&#8217;s conclusion that with today&#8217;s tools and environment, radical innovation is extraordinarily accessible to those who know how to cultivate it.&#8221;*

Okay, so while I could talk about innovation, inspiration, etc&#8230;I&#8217;ll just relegate the topic to the land of subjective relativity and say that a plethora of factors contribute to success. Some are environmental, some are time-related, some are based on luck, most are based on market/social need.

The animated infographic was pretty cool though, huh? With over 280k views, I&#8217;m sure this was a pretty good marketing vehicle for the book. Johnson&#8217;s [&#8220;The Ghost Map&#8221;](../the-ghost-map/) was a fascinating story.
