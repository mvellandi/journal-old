Let&#8217;s face it: Narratives and guided experiences can be really great. Websites and other interactive media experiences do NOT have to be a purely functional browsing experiences. While catalog scenarios may not appear to be suitable for storytelling, let me remind you however of the role that merchandising displays and museum exhibits (big or tiny) play -> to draw people in an generate a specific emotional response, and take action (purchase item, read and learn, other). What I&#8217;m alluding to here is the question of whether a storytelling opportunity may be possible. The simplest form is in writing. Adding more media and interaction options brings depth and greater immersion. Whether someone becomes attracted or delighted isn&#8217;t the point. You designed an opportunity for them to experience something interesting that they didn&#8217;t just scroll past.
