Funny take on communicating with infographics, statistics, and animated text. While I personally love the idea of visualizing abstract information and breaking up ideas into concrete chunks that can be eaten in sometimes a guided narrative, the single most important aspect for such a communication piece to be socially beneficial, is its Usefulness. This in terms of intrinsic value, and the cognitive load it places on users for understanding, emotional appeal, and recall. Otherwise, it&#8217;s just fanciful eye candy that a bunch of creative geeks can gloat over.
