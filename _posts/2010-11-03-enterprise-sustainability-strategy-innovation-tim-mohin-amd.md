Developing sustainable business strategies at the enterprise level really comes down to fundamentally aligning them with your business model and core competencies, as Tim Mohin of [AMD](http://www.amd.com/) explains in this interview with me. For AMD, they&#8217;ve re-calibrated their operations to focus exclusively on product design and development, which includes information technology to enable a smarter planet. Lastly, Tim shares his aspired vision for the integration of corporate responsibility into business management.
