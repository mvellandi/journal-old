Every company has an environmental footprint in terms of its operations and employees&#8217; activities. While these must be addressed, even a software company like [Intuit](http://www.intuit.com/) aspires to do more, as Rupesh Shah explains in this interview with me. Beyond the basics, they&#8217;re also helping their Quickbooks and TurboTax customers to learn about financial incentives for activities with sustainable benefits, in addition to an [exciting application with Freecycle](http://quickbase.intuit.com/freecycle) that promotes reuse within organizations.
