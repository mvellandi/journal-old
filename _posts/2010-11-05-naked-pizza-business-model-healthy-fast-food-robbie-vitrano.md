Can there be a market for healthy fast food? Robbie Vitrano definitely thinks so, as he explains [Naked Pizza&#8217;s mission](http://www.nakedpizza.biz/) with me. Becoming successful and proving market viability requires a sound business model based on an excellent, tasty product and lean operations. Additionally, he talks about his work with Valerie Casey of the [Designers Accord](http://www.designersaccord.org/) in concepting a retail store design and customer experience, and his aspired future of fast food.
