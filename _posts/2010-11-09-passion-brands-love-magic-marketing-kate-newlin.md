Despite my disdain for over-consumption inspired by low prices and fantastic marketing, I still revere the power that brands can hold over us. The ability to transcend the pure functionality of a product/service&#8217;s inherent features is inspiring indeed. Or the strength a nonprofit or NGO has to tower over other competitors vying for our altruism. Now, I could begin talking with fluffy overtones of [Snuggle softness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuggle), or the designful speak of trend houses and brand futurists, but let&#8217;s not go there. The purpose of today&#8217;s post is to examine the aspects that drive passion behind certain brands, whether they are meaningful or beneficial to society or not. What follows is an outline of [Passion Brands](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591026873?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591026873) by Kate Newlin. While it may serve some good tips here, I&#8217;m unable to provide you the many interesting stories and interview quotes from entrepreneurs, marketers, and everyday people. And for that reason, it&#8217;s a recommended read.

__Note__**:** I had purchased Kate&#8217;s other book [Shopportunity](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060888407?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060888407), a fascinating exploration of retail experience design from a variety of store types, and her PR agent had offered me a review copy of Passion Brands last year. Thanks Len and Kate! Sorry for the delay in writing this&#8230;

## Introduction

While I&#8217;ll assume most folks have a pretty good idea what a passion brand is, I&#8217;ll quote Kate&#8217;s attempt at a dictionary-style definition,

* a product so extravagantly lovable that its advocates must spontaneously speak of it, sharing their ardor for it with friends, family, and colleagues, requiring them to love it too.
* a product that creates such personal enthusiasm that purchasers badge themselves with it through conversation, apparel, continuous repeat purchase.
* a brand built day by day with the deep love and joyous advocacy of its customers.

For the biggest fans, they have *&#8220;a relationship more powerful than those we have with many human beings.&#8221;* Among some findings of Kate&#8217;s social research, is that when it comes to word-of-mouth, women are agnostic about the categories they&#8217;ll talk about. Men on the other hand will be more narrow, choosing to talk about tech, car, and other stereotypical male-products.

As a male, I find this almost demeaning and damning of our sex&#8217;s social skills. I&#8217;m curious what [J.D. Power and Associates Web Intelligence division](http://businesscenter.jdpower.com/?f=/jdpacontent/corpcomm/Services/content/webintelligence.htm) would say. Nonetheless, I&#8217;ll give in and admit my belief that by and large, women like shopping and talking more than men. As Kate and Faith Popcorn say, we men are more _&#8220;transaction&#8221;_ oriented than women. For us, an experience is personal and normally not meant to be shared. However, I believe that with the increased use of social media for status updates through Facebook and Twitter, all generations are experiencing the joy that sharing can provide, and passive conversations online can more easily spur recommendations from men. However, I will say that male propensity to share is increasingly an online activity as a result of joining networks and interest-groups. Would we actively recommend food, clothing, or other categories in the real world to other men, out of the blue? Very unlikely, unless there&#8217;s a big passion behind it, AND if someone asks us first. Disliking generalization, I tend to believe there&#8217;s an unwritten male behavioral norm that says every one of us is responsible for learning things on our own and discovering our own likes/dislikes through exploration. Only when we see another man struggling, do we _&#8220;do the right thing&#8221;_ and assist.

## 1) Adopt and Promote a Shared Worldview

Why? Because it transcends demographics of age, race, or gender. Obviously, if you&#8217;re a toy manufacturer, it&#8217;s likely a different story. Some categories are best suited to a demographic focus for market or cultural reasons. But I&#8217;d say the majority of categories don&#8217;t necessarily have to cater to a specific audience type. To use classical segmentation and assumptions on demographic appeal is just wrong! Okay, let&#8217;s get a little more concrete here (since that&#8217;s a passion value of mine).

Kate brings up the Toyota Prius, which became popular for it&#8217;s innovation and eco-appeal. And the marketing behind it didn&#8217;t cater to young, old, environmentalist, or other label. [Chemistry.com](http://chemistry.com/) is another example that was developed by Match.com as a counter to eHarmony&#8217;s &#8220;values-based&#8221; matchmaking criteria, which had systematically discriminated against modern people who engage in pre-marrital sex, the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transexual) community, and other people that for some unknown reason or another, didn&#8217;t fit the screening criteria. The sad part was that rejected people had no clue why there were no matches for them, since eHarmony didn&#8217;t identify these values as part of its brand identity, which IMO would have been the right thing to do. So Chemistry.com leveraged that as part of its identity, and [used print and tv ads to promote its open-minded worldview](http://www.onlinedatingmagazine.com/industry/commercials/chemistrycommercials.html).

Peet&#8217;s Coffee chain appeals to creative people. Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (in Southern California) is similar, but whose atmosphere (in my personal experience) best fosters dialogue and hanging out. Starbucks has its own promoters and detractors for various reasons.

So let&#8217;s address the fundamental attribute here. A brand identity based on a worldview, rather than a demographic, will attract a larger and more culturally diverse customer base. Maybe it&#8217;s based on a political ideology conservative, progressive, libertarian, anarchistic, or neo-Confucian Chinese (paternalistic libertarian with a heavy dose of social Darwinism). Maybe it&#8217;s based on a love for the outdoors, arts, or luxury living. Whatever it is, it&#8217;ll have broad appeal. This element of brand personality transcends the functional nature of the commercial transaction.

Maybe a particular brand&#8217;s value proposition already inherently appeals to a wide audience. That&#8217;s okay. But without a distinct personal worldview, traits, and values, the brand is essentially sterile and it won&#8217;t attract (or detract people) based on emotion.

## 2) Use Design as a Differentiator and Lovemark

I think most of y&#8217;all understand this well enough. Apple, Porsche, Crocs (shoes), and Flip video cameras come to mind. So let&#8217;s break down Design into some various aspects:

Aesthetics, Ergonomics, Usability, Durability, Language, User Experience, and Customer Service (proactive and reactive).

## 3) Hire Passionate Employees

Functionally qualified staff can do great work, but they won&#8217;t go out of their way to help customers nor have the ability to relate to them as well as employees who find increasing affinity to the work they do and especially to the particular brand. Kate recounts early in the chapter of a colleague at P&G whose only aspiration was to advance her career, make more money, and jump around to the next opportunity. Some brands, organizational cultures, and individuals live and perpetuate a commoditized attitude. And that&#8217;s okay. But to stimulate employee happiness, increase customer service, decrease absenteeism, increase retention rates, and lower training costs&#8230;hiring folks that like your brand or the activities and values it espouses, is just better business. For everything else without the extra baggage, just hire a consultant! ðŸ™‚

Happy and enthusiastic employees are also more likely to positively talk about their work and affiliated brands with other people including family, friends, and the growing circle of online acquaintances. And that&#8217;s a great natural marketing benefit.

## 4) Engage Customers and Become More Personal

If you&#8217;ve read the [Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465018653?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465018653), understand how ineffective advertising has become, or how the explosion of private-label merchandise and diverse product distribution beyond limited-category retail chains has affected purchasing attitudes and people&#8217;s perceptions of brands&#8230;then you get the idea. In Kate&#8217;s words,

> *&#8220;Consumers need and want to experience their brands in new and emerging ways, and brands need consumers in the same old way &#8211; sales. But the same old ways to achieve brand awareness, trial, purchase, and loyalty eventually stop working and we&#8217;re required to approach the relationship anew. It&#8217;s not enough to get consumers *[seriously Kate, let&#8217;s limit using this awful noun]* to buy the brand; we have to help them help us market it to their peers, their social network, and their families. They know it, and we ignore it at our own peril.&#8221;*

It&#8217;s true. Most brands have to become a little more humanistic and/or personal in all touchpoints to stand out. Be it in advertising, PR, product design and packaging, and especially interpersonal communication (live or online).

## 5) Democratize the Brand

While there&#8217;s a variety of ways to interpret this like allowing folks to customizing the product/service, Kate breaks it down to the degrees of control, input, and ownership that customers have with the brand.

  * __Social Research__ &#8211; The baseline for user-centered brand innovation. Includes surveys, attitudinal studies, focus groups, ethnography, hypnosis, brain scanning, and oxytocin-laced cookies which make subjects tell you their deepest thoughts & brand desires (that would be funny though).
  * __Co-Production__ &#8211; The user has greater flexibility in interacting with the brand, or has to do some work to get the product/service to their liking (like flatpack furniture, cake mixes that require you add ingredients of your own, traditional LEGOs, Nike custom-designed online shoe creator).
  * __Co-Marketing__ &#8211; Users are invited or incentivized to create ads, messaging, taglines, art, etc. In many ways, this approach can seem pretentious and just plain lazy marketing on the brand&#8217;s behalf. I think that if in instances where the brand does have passionate customers, a fair contest or other plan is set up, incentives are established, and fans feel their contribution was recognized and worthwhile somehow, this option can work. However since I do PR, I&#8217;m highly wary of any type of advertising schemes. Word-of-mouth is more powerful than ads, and the main idea is to help your passionate customers express themselves and their affinity with your brand, its values, or a particular cause.
  * __Partnership__ &#8211; The closest type of relationship possible, while still retaining some brand control and revenues. Examples include eBay, Amazon associate seller programs, Wikipedia, Threadless, and Etsy. Regardless of the amount of customization options, ability for users to make money too, the primary trait is the business or sub-brand&#8217;s operations NEED a community to exist.

## 6) Use Backstories and Arcs

Every passion brand needs one, because stories describe how such excellence came to be, how the brand was borne out of the founder&#8217;s desire to make a delicious organic ice cream, how some local citizens took it upon themselves to build a fresh vegetable distribution organization to bring local farmers&#8217; food to the city or suburbs. How Walt Disney came up with the plan for his park in Anaheim, CA and the toils it took to imagineer and actualize the Magic Kingdom. Facts don&#8217;t hold anything interesting in and of themselves. So stories, whether actual, embellished, or fake will help many entrepreneurs get their first press or word-of-mouth going. If it&#8217;s good, it&#8217;ll be memorable and relatively easy to share since exact details won&#8217;t matter.

## 7) Brand the Buzz

Create rumors, listen for them, and act on OR against them. Employ surprise. Be funny and creative through various PR stunts, exceptional customer service, and event sponsorships. Ideas will obviously vary, but it really just comes down to storytelling, strategic actions to support a campaign or aspect of brand identity, and being unexpectedly delightful. Doing so will stimulate word-of-mouth and sales.

## Wrapping It All Up

Apply these seven techniques to build a passion brand. Kate gives additional reasons why this form of marketing is desperately needed nowadays in order to stand out. I&#8217;ll just say though that this requires first a great service or product to begin with. Otherwise, it&#8217;s all just cheap icing which could backfire and cost a lot of money and maybe even generate negative sentiment if people don&#8217;t find congruency between their expectations and their actual brand experience.
