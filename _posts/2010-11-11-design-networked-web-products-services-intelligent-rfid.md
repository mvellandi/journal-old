Digital interactions are moving beyond keypad and screens and into more products and environments, by using multiple senses and attention spans. They are networked products that will inhabit our everyday lives.

[Timo Arnall](http://www.elasticspace.com/) presents on this topic of designing for networked objects, which is a little slow at the very beginning but really grabs you once he shows some concrete examples of how RFID enabled objects combined with a reader, change the activities in a game on a television (you&#8217;ll just have to see it!). Here are the degrees of interaction and thoughts that I jotted down:

1) **Immediate** Tangible Experience &#8211; The ability to touch, grasp, move, and physically interact with a networked object is very important. We can&#8217;t just be thinking of screens and user interfaces (button, touch) which necessitate a full attention span. Some examples include Nike Plus and the Watson clock. See the slideshows below for others. Communication, alerts, and other interactions can be enabled through multiple senses as well.

2) **Short term** Connecting and Sharing &#8211; These interactions last a bit longer, but for participation rates to be sustainable, the service needs to provide users a valuable benefit to connecting and sharing. Feedback systems have to work well. A sense of purpose has to be understood and valued by users, beyond novelty & experimentation.

3) **Long term** Service, Data, and Visualization &#8211; Interactions that provide us a lasting benefit, perhaps regarding resource consumption in the household, your personal health, your child&#8217;s learning, and so on.

Lastly, Timo brings up an important point in that these types of interaction systems require a LOT of thought and consideration regarding value to the user. Because if we design products and platforms that don&#8217;t end up being adopted beyond lead users, there&#8217;s a huge waste of money and time. This made me think about the importance of stable platforms, protocols, and other technical specifications.

I think there&#8217;s a lot of potential to enhance people&#8217;s lives through passive awareness of conditions that are meaningful to us, which allow for greater convenience in functional daily activities, and don&#8217;t require much mental energy or using our eyes.
