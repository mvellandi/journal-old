Since I&#8217;m on a book review train now (since rehashing for yourself and others helps solidify concepts in meaningful and personally relevant ways), let&#8217;s take the next stop with one I read back in early 2008: Seth Godin&#8217;s [Meatball Sundae](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ACPM54?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002ACPM54). Yucky name, I know. While a quick and amusing read, it would have been better as an extended essay than a book, although his publisher would have complained about money left on the table.

Seth&#8217;s premise is that if social & permission based (valued & relevant) marketing is mixed together with interruptive, irrelevant, and traditional marketing&#8230;the result is a distasteful user experience. And that&#8217;s not good.

Looking back retrospectively, sure it makes a LOT of sense. Permission based marketing is meant to provide people with relevant content or offers that THEY like and opt-in to receive. If marketing exploits that permission to intermittently spam people, irrelevantly advertise to them, or use the relationship beyond the terms of customer perceived value&#8230;the marketing gets out of sync, and results in mixed channel messaging.

Similarly when actively engaging with folks using social media, the perceived brand experience has to reflect a personal experience that is more customer service oriented than sales or marketing oriented. Otherwise the user experience is again disrupted and these channels lose a distinct and consistent voice (not good for branding).

Those are the takeaways, and are VERY important for any folks (professional, newbie, part-time) involved in marketing & public relations to know. There&#8217;s a psychological art to digital PR. Perform it wrong or inconsistently, and you&#8217;ll lose face.
