Did you know that a packaging re-design could remove 12,000 trucks off the road? Kirsi Sormunen of [Nokia](http://nokia.com) explains in this interview with me, on how a move toward compact packaging has resulted in significant cost and environmental savings. Additional topics include consumer awareness of mobile phone recycling, as well as developing software applications and services that encourage sustainable behavior.
