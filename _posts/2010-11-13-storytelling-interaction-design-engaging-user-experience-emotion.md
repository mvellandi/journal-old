Cindy Chastain talks about the role and importance of storytelling in interaction design, and how it&#8217;s already in place to various degrees. But that when we step in the role of the customer and think in terms of the story playing out in their head as they progress through a website, we can develop better empathy for how we&#8217;re engaging them on both cognitive and emotional levels. In doing so, we can better steer them toward how we progressively want them to feel and react over time. Explaining both storytelling theory and craft techniques, Cindy does a marvelous job of making making a just parallel between storytelling and interaction design, and relating it to user experience that is beyond functional usability and libertarian approaches to UX.
