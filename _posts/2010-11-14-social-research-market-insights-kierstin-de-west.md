When it comes to market research for people&#8217;s attitudes and behaviors toward green and sustainability, the most insightful approach should be holistic, as [Kierstin De West of CI](http://ci-shift.com/) explains in this interview with me. Instead of just relying on attitudinal studies on green alone, meaningful social research will combine quantitative, qualitative, and trend analyses with the broader scope of culture at large. Kierstin also describes a bit about the feedback she&#8217;s received so far, as well as what she believes the future holds for applied social studies.
