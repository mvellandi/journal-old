If vast volumes of media are becoming available for on-demand distribution through APIs onto a variety of surfaces and channels, what could the future hold? If we just assume that it&#8217;s there and requires little mental energy, I think the possibilities are endless. [Dentsu London](http://www.dentsulondon.com/) and [Berg London](http://berglondon.com/) have teamed up to produce a pair of short films on this topic, shown below.

One concern that a commenter pointed out on the [Fast Company article](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662620/can-media-be-more-ubiquitous-yet-less-invasive-dentsu-and-berg-show-how) where I found this, said that we should be mindful of the resource consumption and ecological impact that media and devices for passive utility will have. And I couldn&#8217;t more fully agree. It all comes down to a cost/benefit analysis no?
