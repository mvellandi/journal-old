What&#8217;s better than tasting high quality, great tasting chocolate? Knowing that the cacao farmers are doing well too. [John Scharffenberger](http://www.scharffenberger.com/) discusses in this interview with me, the work that he does with the [Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org) in Ghana to improve cacao farmers&#8217; farming methods, production yield, and quality. Additionally, he talks about the current situation in the marketplace of confectioners and farmers at last working more closely together, how the produced chocolate is largely unknown to children in these countries or not as widely available as one might think, and what he sees as the future issues to be addressed in farming and sustainable development.
