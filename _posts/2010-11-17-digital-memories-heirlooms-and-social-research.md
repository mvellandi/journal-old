This presentation by Richard Banks of Microsoft Research, examines the role of the digital objects, products and services we are designing today as they take over from physical things as the primary way we remember our past. What are our responsibilities as designers in making sure not only that people’s lives are preserved for reminiscing, but also that the record of their past can be passed on to their offspring and become part of a family’s history?

I loved this talk for the large number of backstories and examples that Richard provides as part of the research they conducted into how people kept memories of their lives in the past, how it was passed on to grandchildren, the sense of obligation we have to someday sort and go through all this, and the role that technology can play in preserving memories in a media-rich organized fashion, perhaps with additional contextually-relevant general information pulled from web encyclopedias.

An insightful look into human behavior indeed. I question that with ability to make large numbers of photos, status updates, and other media, can we expect others to spend time to preserve and go through memories of ours. Unless it has good meta data, categorization, and converted and stored appropriately as decades progress, there will perhaps just be too much to deal with. As with individuals today, the amount of personal media generated and the degree of organization & data tagging varies widely. Some future generations will be thankful for their ancestors&#8217; behaviors. Many others will be out of luck. Is memorabilia really that important? I suppose it all depends&#8230;
