Traditional loyalty marketing programs work on a small scale. However, to reach large numbers of shoppers and greater influence green purchasing, a coalition of leading manufacturers, retailers, and service providers is needed. Enter [EcoBonus](http://www.ecobonus.com/coalition/). Jan Wickman describes the coalition and their mission, the current situation in the marketplace, and what she sees as the future of rewards based programs that scale AND have a meaningful impact.
