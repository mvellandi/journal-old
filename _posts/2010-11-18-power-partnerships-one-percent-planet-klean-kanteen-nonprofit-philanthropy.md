Nonprofit and brand partnerships are essential for making effective business philanthropy work. Danielle Creswell of [Klean Kanteen](http://www.kleankanteen.com/) and Melody Grote of [1% For the Planet](http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/en/) discuss the mission of their individual organizations, the chemistry behind their partnership, and how proactive companies can by developing relationships and cooperative activities, make a greater impact than simply writing a check alone.
