How is the retail industry currently performing in regards to sustainability? Secondly, as the primary interface between brands and the public, what kind of social responsibility do they have? [Kevin Brady of Five Winds International](http://www.fivewinds.com/) and [David Ian Grey of Dig 360](http://www.dig360.ca/), discuss the answers to these two questions posed by me, along with their advice to retailers regarding the role they can play in promoting a healthy, green lifestyle by products they carry and through the shopping experience.
