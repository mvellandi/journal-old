I love the availability of independent short films.

Today I bring you some of my favorites from a series called [Break-Ups](http://www.breakups.us/)

[Katy & Ted &#8211; Video Link for Email/Other Subscribers &#8211; 4min](http://vimeo.com/11900273)

Katy is domineering and enjoys a parenting relationship. Beginning halfway through, her language increasingly indicates this, especially when she mentions the various Pygmalion gifts she has provided Ted. Nurturing has its limits in loving relationships: when conditionality, selfishness, and fear are strongly present.

When acceptance prevails, shared humor and memories act as the temporary binder. Touching.
