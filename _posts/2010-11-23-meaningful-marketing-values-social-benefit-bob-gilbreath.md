If the interruptive model that advertising provides is increasingly becoming less effective, is there a new role for marketers to play and structure for them to use? [Bob Gilbreath of Bridge Worldwide](http://www.bridgeworldwide.com/) gives a resounding Yes in this interview with me, in which he describes the importance of meaning, a key theme of his book &#8220;The Next Evolution of Marketing&#8221;. In order for brands to better connect with people today, they need to help them solve or learn something, develop a sense of connection, and realize personal achievements. Bob also discusses the future of how agencies and brands will need to operate in values-based society.
