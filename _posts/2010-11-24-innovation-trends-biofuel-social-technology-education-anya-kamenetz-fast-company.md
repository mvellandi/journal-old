Which three big trends are having a significant impact on society today? Listen to Anya Kamenetz of Fast Company magazine discuss them in conversation with me. Topics include biofuels from algae and the current economics behind them; Social media for social impact through collaborative technologies that provide a collective benefit for aid workers in Haiti, for example; and what excites her about alternative education models based on open-source thinking and provide a customized, on-demand learning experience that can vastly benefit society.
