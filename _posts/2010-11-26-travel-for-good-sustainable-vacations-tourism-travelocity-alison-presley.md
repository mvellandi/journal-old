Taking a vacation AND doing good? Very compatible says Alison Presley, who heads up [Travelocity&#8217;s &#8220;Travel for Good&#8221; program](http://www.travelocity.com/TravelForGood/index.html), which she describes in this interview with me. Part of the agency&#8217;s program is to offer guests lighter footprint options through eco-friendly hotels, hybrid car rentals, and offsets. Another initiative that runs every quarter, gives one lucky applicant a $5000 volunteer vacation grant to spend time abroad working on a terrific cause of their choice, in partnership with selected 3rd party organizations who run dedicated voluntourism projects. Lastly, Alison talks about what she hopes for the future in sustainable tourism and travel.
