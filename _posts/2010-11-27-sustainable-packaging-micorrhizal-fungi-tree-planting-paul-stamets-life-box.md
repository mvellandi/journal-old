How can fungi fight climate change? Why, as part of a unique packaging solution that contains them and tree seeds, that when planted will produce healthy trees. Paul Stamets, founder of [Life Box](http://www.lifeboxcompany.com/), speaks with me about his company&#8217;s mission to re-green the planet and sequester more carbon from the atmosphere in what he calls a &#8220;shovel ready solution to climate change.&#8221;
