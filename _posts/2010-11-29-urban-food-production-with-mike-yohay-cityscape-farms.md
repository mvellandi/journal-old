Given the increasing migration to and general resource efficiencies that cities provide, does it make sense to grow food there as well? Absolutely, says Mike Yohay of [Cityscape Farms](http://www.cityscapefarms.com/), which creates urban greenhouse systems for agricultural production with low water use. In this interview (with a cute acquaintance of mine), he describes his firm&#8217;s mission, their use of aquaponic irrigation, and how urban farming is ideal for a food chain in an increasingly water-constrained world.
