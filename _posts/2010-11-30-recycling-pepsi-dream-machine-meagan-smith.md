Given that bottle and can recycling rates are fairly low for a variety of reasons including availability and awareness, Pepsi is hoping to increase participation and influence attitudes across the U.S. through its [Dream Machine](http://www.pepsico.com/PressRelease/Dream-Machine-Challenges-Americans-to-Commit-to-Recycle-Cans-and-Bottles-From-Su06282010.html). Meagan Smith is the program manager and in this interview with me, discusses the current situation in American society regarding beverage container recycling from a systemic perspective, and explains how they aim to positively influence cultural attitudes (and action!) in the future.
