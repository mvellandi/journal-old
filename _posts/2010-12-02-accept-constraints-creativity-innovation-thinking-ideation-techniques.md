In Ernie Schenck&#8217;s book [The Houdini Solution](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/007146204X?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=007146204X), his main point is that constraints make us more creative. And hell, it&#8217;s how the world works. Greenfield projects with unlimited risk, funding, and guaranteed multi-party approval just don&#8217;t exist. Given that fact, the metaphorical &#8220;box&#8221; establishes boundaries from which we have to work in. When acknowledging and sometimes challenging those boundaries, better ideas will emerge within the scope of a project&#8217;s objective, or the problem to be solved. This is what I had learned from practical experience in new product development. The ocean may be vast, but our ability to navigate & travel only goes so far because of brand alignment constraints, technical viability, and financial limitations like costs, payback period, and return on investment.

While Ernie is an adman, he wrote this book for creative thinking as applied to any problem. Much of the book uses historical examples of problems solved in both marketing and other disciplines, with the last 40 pages containing toward around ~40 ideation techniques, along with mental exercises. I recommend this book for its ability to be quickly read, enjoyed, and for the ideation techniques at the end. A used copy will be very cheap to find on Amazon. Let&#8217;s take an extended gander at some of those techniques!

## The Opposing View

Take any problem you&#8217;re trying to solve, and reframe the goal in the opposite direction. What impediments or things could you do to make things worse? How can you incite fear or distrust in your initial concept? This exercise helps identify roadblocks and hindrances that a devil&#8217;s advocate will place in the way. Overcome them by finding weak spots where efficiency, persuasion, or other tactics can be applied.

## Creative Snowballing

Have a group contribute ideas, one person after the other, to a creative objective with a couple parameters. No idea is wrong, impractical, or too fantastical (unless it defies the laws of nature). Soon the snowball gets bigger and bigger. The nice part is that since all the ideas are related to the objective, it&#8217;ll be easier to keep the conversation focused and ideas organized.

## Have an Angel&#8217;s Advocate

There are good devil&#8217;s advocates and bad ones. A facilitator should be available to encourage good behavior, and tactfully handles emotion-laden and subjective criticism. But beyond that, having someone who helps encourage further inquiry into how an idea might be further beneficial in other aspects, is important to have.

## Concise Problem Definition

Great solutions first require having a good problem to solve. That&#8217;s half the battle. So let&#8217;s whittle and scope the various objectives in writing to a sentence of 12-15 words. Remember that everyone attributes different meanings, connotations, and examples to words. If we copyedit the hell out the problem to the size of a single tweet at 140 characters, that allows greater focus on a narrower sets of nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

## Determining Each Border&#8217;s Length

With a concise statement for the problem, we&#8217;re left with a bunch of words including subject, actions, objects, adjectives, adverbs, potential conditional statements, etc. Examine each word and phrase to further define what it means, and what it doesn&#8217;t. Language can be quite subjective as you know. To make it perfectly clear, we&#8217;ll have to think in legal speak and add additional footnotes to the problem. &#8220;Quickly&#8221; can be understood as &#8220;four months&#8221;, &#8220;executive approval&#8221; can be understood as two goals like &#8220;immediate commitment with full funding&#8221; or &#8220;commitment with partial funding and review dates to be determined&#8221;. If I gave you the words &#8220;book&#8221;, &#8220;yogurt&#8221;, and &#8220;biofuel&#8221;, how would you further define them according to preferable parameters aligned with the creative brief, brand identity, and product innovation strategy.

## The Repetitive Why?

A classic technique that forces us to explain the reasoning for actions, conditions, assumptions, motives, and more. There is no linear path as the there&#8217;s likely to be multiple answers to each iteration, yet each person can only choose one. When we repeat the exercise with multiple people, we start to shed light on sometimes the understated beliefs, fears, and hopes that may or may not be necessarily true, but felt by one or more persons.

## In Someone Else&#8217;s Shoes

Okay, so this can go a couple ways. Imagine that you&#8217;re:

  1. A specific user persona by profession OR worldview. What needs do they have? How might they react to your concepts?
  2. Someone famous or well-known. How would they design or address the problem given their background and perceived character strengths.

## SCAMPER

Play and analysis technique based on the acronym&#8217;s verb components,

  1. __Substitute__ &#8211; What can I substitute for what&#8217;s here now? What can I use instead? Would other materials work? Is there another path, color, typeface, photo, environment, music, actor, text, time, you name it.
  2. __Combine__ &#8211; What can I combine or bring together somehow? Would these two go together? Can two goals be unified?
  3. __Adapt__ &#8211; Is there an existing material, component, object, or solution that can be adapted? What else has similar characteristics? Is there a previously used or alternative solution (for different context) that could be refurbished to my objective?
  4. __Modify__ &#8211; Can we change some aspects to make something new? Consider adding or subtracting elements, and changing aesthetics, form, size, density, and so on.
  5. __Put to Other Uses__ &#8211; Are there alternative uses for this? Different ways to use this? If it was modified, would there be additional usage scenarios or options?
  6. __Eliminate__ &#8211; What can be removed without impairing core functionality? Are there cost reduction options? What if it was simplified? What if certain aesthetic features were eliminated?
  7. __Rearrange__ &#8211; What can be rearranged or moved around somehow? What if some mappings were switched? Is there an alternative order of operations?

## Stopwatch It

Apply time limitations to various creative exercises. Have a clock in the room, or a running stopwatch nearby to remind you (or the team) that time is ticking, but don&#8217;t let it be too conspicuous.

## Chopping Block

Similar to concise problem definitions, this technique simply asks you to take your ideas and in either written or spoken words, begin with a 3o second version or 500 words, then edit that down multiple times by 50%. Notice how when you remove details, it may become more (or less) clear. Substitute words and phrase for better clarity as appropriate.

.

There are PLENTY of others that Ernie brought up or you can read in creativity books galore. While I&#8217;m no expert, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to know the simplest and most practical ones.
