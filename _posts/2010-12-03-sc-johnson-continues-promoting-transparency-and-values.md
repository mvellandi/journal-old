So last week, Zach of Edelman Digital sent me an email about SC Johnson&#8217;s new television spot regarding their renewed commitment to people&#8217;s health through chemical transparency. That&#8217;s the message intended to appeal to most Americans.

What I find intriguing is the unique form of values branding SC Johnson is taking here. No defense of practices known or unknown. Just advocacy. While their business is from a marketer&#8217;s POV, giving people clean homes and peace of mind, one cannot escape the questions of human health and safety.

Common bleach is very powerful and needs a lot of dilution to be considered &#8220;safe&#8221; to many. Yet to environmental and human health advocates, its use has substantial side effects. The same goes for a variety of other chemicals in cleaning, food, and beverage products. The response has been the rise of ethical brands like Method through great design, improved production economics, and distribution. And don&#8217;t think for one minute that these brands have grown merely on increased public demand. Sales, marketing, design, and operations experts have joined these companies because they offer new growth opportunities that P&G, Unilvever, SC Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser, Clorox, and other mega brand families could not.

So back to values branding. For established big companies like SC Johnson, its function is partly defense and partly advocacy. Defense against the charge of smaller brands that claim to be &#8220;healthier&#8221; and &#8220;safer&#8221;. Advocacy for trust, people&#8217;s health, and business responsibility.

While I can&#8217;t remark on whether SC Johnson is a truly values-oriented or greenwashing company, their ad campaign represents the continuation of the [What&#8217;s Inside communications program](http://www.whatsinsidescjohnson.com/) started in 2009. From a marketing perspective, it&#8217;s well crafted and seems authentic. Hardcore eco-advocates may say that the chemical safety criteria in their [GreenList program](http://www.scjohnson.com/en/commitment/focus-on/greener-products/greenlist.aspx) become more transparent too. I personally think they&#8217;re doing a great job in comparison to many other companies, and if you dig further on the website, you&#8217;ll find a lot of humble language and mentions of third party collaboration and endorsements. Interestingly enough, I just read that they&#8217;re working with Five Winds International (a reputable manufacturing/retail consultancy), to license the GreenList process to other manufacturers too.

Should we expect to see similar marketing from more brands in the future? You bet. For those that dare to take on ethics, values, and trust in an authentic and credible manner. Otherwise it&#8217;s just a green & causewashed campaign.
