Over the years, [The Gap](http://www.gap.com/) has evolved its corporate responsibility work from addressing the working conditions within garment factories, to environmental impacts, and now trying to improve the lives of workers and their communities. Kindley Walsh Lawlor describes their evolution with me, in addition to their approach toward sustainability communications and reporting.
