Annie Leonard is at it again with an awareness campaign. This time on electronics and their lifecycle, in which she and her illustrators use scare tactics, dramatize, and embellish parts of their story beyond what I think is fair and objective. However, I do appreciate three points she brings up: that we can&#8217;t shop our way out of this situation, it&#8217;s up to us to try and responsibly recycle, and to support legislation for take-back laws and extended producer responsibility.
