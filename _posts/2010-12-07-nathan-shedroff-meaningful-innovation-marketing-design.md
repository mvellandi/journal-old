The subject of today&#8217;s lesson plan is MEANING.

Yes, that invisible force that signifies importance on an abstract, personally relevant level.

I love Meaning due to its semantic relation to Values. Having met Nathan and read his book, [Design is the Problem](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933820004?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1933820004), I was highly engaged in watching his presentation because well, I don&#8217;t always have the time or money to read a whole book, nor do I understand the material&#8217;s context from his [online collection of thoughts](http://nathan.com/thoughts/). So here are the main ideas:

Meaning is the deepest connection you can make with a customer/user/audience. It is one sub-aspect of Experience.

Experience is an inherent element of a design&#8217;s outcome, whether planned, intended, or not. And it&#8217;s usually difficult for many people to grasp because of its intangibility. [My thoughts: Especially business people that don&#8217;t consider psychological and human factors in product development because of an assumption that the explicit value proposition spiced up with personally-appealing aesthetic features is what will sell.]

<img title="experience design attributes by nathan shedroff" src="../images/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/experience-design-attributes-nathan-shedroff.jpg" alt="elements of user experience design" width="502" height="450" />

So when we look at the &#8220;Significance&#8221; category, we&#8217;ll see the following five attributes in order of importance to the individual: Meaning, Status/Identity, Emotion/Lifestyle, Price, and Function.

Seems quite agreeable to me 🙂 Nathan explains that while emotional appeal is surely an important attribute, emotions are inherently transient. They don&#8217;t last. So although the products/services and so on that we design or consume could be emotionally appealing, they&#8217;re not necessarily sustainable. For higher order customer affinity and eco-effectiveness (if we assume eventual replacement), designers and marketers should strive for appealing to identity and meaning, which will carry greater relevancy with us through our life stages. Those brands and products will also be more successful because they&#8217;ll appeal to higher order needs, and not rely on novelty alone. Example: Coca-Cola and BMW.

Nathan refers to [15 Meanings](http://www.makingmeaning.org/meanings.html) which he and some co-authors identified in the book [Making Meaning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321552342?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321552342). While these were identified as universal across various cultures, people prioritize and express them differently. Hence the importance for ethnographic research for relevancy when designing products, services, environments, and communications.

Ergo: All design is a process of evoking (but not creating) meaning. Ironic considering the title of that aforementioned book 😉

Lastly, Nathan says that if we&#8217;re to employ meaning as a strategic design tool, we should determine the meanings of the organization (brand) and product concepts, and test for congruency. If concepts don&#8217;t match the brand, then there won&#8217;t be alignment.

To which I&#8217;ll say, either ditch the concept, sell the IP, or create a new division that can develop and market the concept.
