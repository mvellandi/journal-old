Writing, oh how I adore your contribution to UX.

Denise is from [MOO Cards](http://us.moo.com/), a fun online business card printing company out of the UK.

There are 4 Vectors of Brand Tangibility:

  * Product
  * Environment
  * Communications &#8211; identity, value proposition, navigation, newsletters, marketing, transactions
  * Behavior &#8211; Customer service, social media

While writing itself can&#8217;t improve the first two areas, it definitely influences the customer experience in the latter two.

If we consider people&#8217;s behavior in scanning webpages to find and read only elements interesting to us, and muddle our way through to accomplishing tasks we set out to do, then writing should be focused and strategic. Secondly, it should be clear and straightforward too if we consider that America&#8217;s average reading skills are at the 8th/9th grade school level.

In websites, we can&#8217;t have conversations unless there&#8217;s a live operator or chat. Instead we design monologues where you&#8217;re trying to get people to like you, and buy/donate/act. But again, gone are are the days of grand proclamations and advertising-related brand messaging for identity purposes. The brand voice has to be authentic, engaging, and sound human. To develop it throughout your writing and especially for a homepage, we have to ask ourselves the following questions:

  1. What&#8217;s the real reason people are visiting your site?
  2. What are you really doing for your customers?

This brings up Empathy&#8230;

> *&#8220;When you put yourself in the mind of the customer, you can figure out when something sounds too &#8216;salesy&#8217; or inauthentic, because you&#8217;ll know what customers care about most.&#8221;*

New and returning site visitors will have one of two experiences:

  * **Majority**: Like the brand

    Interaction Stages: Read -> Understand -> Transact -> Leave
  * **Minority**: Love the brand

    Interaction Stages: Read -> Understand -> Transact -> Join Tribe/Fan Club

No matter what though, an organization has to effectively get people through the first 3 stages. Write for the majority. Once that&#8217;s taken care of, we can do fun stuff regarding personality brand messaging.

**BUT** Context is everything. Writing that is too reflective of its brand personality can become annoying to some guests.

For MOO, their personality writing comes especially through their packaging, blog, and social media channels. On marketing emails though, you can be personable, but one should also be objective.

The last interesting part of Denise&#8217;s story regards Little MOO, an automated email service that provides customer updates about the status of their order in a neat, personable way that some customers absolutely adore.
