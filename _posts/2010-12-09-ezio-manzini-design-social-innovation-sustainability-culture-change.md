[Ezio Manzini](http://www.sustainable-everyday.net/) is an esteemed designer and lecturer on the topics of social innovation, sustainability, and the like.

He sees 3 signals of a possible sustainable future

## Individuals and Communities inventing new ways of living

__Food__

Farmers markets, food cooperatives, urban farms and gardens, community-supported agriculture.

* Local and dis-intermediated food networks

**Cities and Public Spaces

** Neighborhood care/upkeep, festivals, gardens, restaurants

** Local and open initiatives for public space renewal*

**Welfare and Social Services

** Elderly self-helping communities, distributed nurse residencies

** Collaborative services for an active welfare*

## Digital platforms become catalysts of social resources

__Collective action for benefit to individuals and/or others__

* Aggregate for social action (ex: [pledgebank.com](http://www.pledgebank.com/))

* Smart mobs (ex: [activmob.com](http://www.activmob.com/))

## Emergence of a new vision as synthesis of previous two

The interplay of 4 keywords: Small, Local, Connected, and Open

Design for Social Innovation attempts to integrate all four.

**Small/Local**: Interwoven issues of scale, relationships, and identity. (Danger: can lead to isolationism and ethnocentrism).**

Open/Connected**: Rise of unprecedented forms of organization.**

Small/Connected**: Being a node in a network

**Local/Open**: The connected local. Cosmopolitan; increased cultural diversity

## **Design for Whom?**

Don&#8217;t consider people as passive users and/or consumers, but as actors of the process: active subjects, capable to take decisions and shape their lives.

** Design for co-designers + co-producers*

__Inspirational Philosophies__

1) [Lao Tzu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_Tzu): Teaching skills for self-sufficiency and improvement

2) [Ivan Illich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich): Tools for conviviality

3) [Amartya Sen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen): **[Capabilities approach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach)**

## What to Design?

Answer: **Enabling Systems**

Ezio tells a great story from China about a family that orders food online, it gets delivered, they can go visit the farm on the weekend, and have lunch with others there.

Platforms to Enable will have 4 Aspects:

  1. **Accessibility** (digital interfaces)
  2. **Effective** (delivery)
  3. **Trust** (social; face to face interactions)
  4. **Beauty** (desirable)

Although Ethics is nice and indeed important, Beauty is a consistently effective motivator for adoption, trial, and long term behavior change.
