What impact do emerging technologies have on news publishers? How will users interact with media in 1,2, or 5 years? Alexis Lloyd of the NY Times Research & Development division explores how changes in technology and consumer behavior can be used to facilitate innovative content experiences.

**Presentation Notes:**

  * Multiple electronic devices coming to market; notably smartphones, netbooks, tablets, hybrids, appliances
  * Result of small and low-power processors, open source operating systems and modular hardware
  * We&#8217;re going from **one** multi-purpose computer (past), to **many** multi-purpose devices (present), to **many single and multi-purpose objects** that happen to have computers in them
  * As connected computers become embedded in everything, our interactions with information will radically evolve. No more proxies between users and information; the user interface falls away a lot more
  * Voice recognition systems, sensors for detecting movement & orientation, location based services, image recognition, multi-touch and gestural interaction, object awareness with near field communication, augmented reality in devices through cameras and contextual information display
  * Consuming content is less a standalone experience as it becomes intertwined with everyday life, in the midst of other experiences
  * Publishers need to create &#8220;sticky&#8221; content that can be accessed outside of their own environments. Current monetization models are immature for these experiences
  * The world is becoming awash in data from people, devices, and organizations. Manual and Automated
  * People are gravitating toward new entry points that are acting as better filters for this data. Historically they were portals and websites. Now they&#8217;re through devices, apps, social networks, and data mashups
  * Contextual relevant info and links are increasingly possible through better meta data, structure, filters, and algorithms
  * Content owners need to structure their information so that it can be easily found through a variety of new filters, platforms, and interfaces.
  * We&#8217;re going from browsing static documents, to tapping into and creating personal streams of messages
  * With ubiquitous connectivity, messages flow between people, organizations, and applications instantaneously
  * Social media&#8217;s effect on communication between organizations and individuals is profound
  * New devices, applications, and permissions systems (inherent or limited) is sending more information to us, rather than us having to seek it out. Email was just the beginning of automated alerts
  * Streams of messages make all information more conversational
  * At the NY Times, in 2005 a discussion theme was &#8220;convening communities&#8221;. Now it&#8217;s &#8220;catalyzing conversations&#8221;
  * The Real-Time Web is challenging Google&#8217;s search-and-find paradigm. Eric Schmidt (Google CEO) asked, &#8220;We can index the real-time web information &#8211; but how do we rank it?&#8221;. The link economy doesn&#8217;t hold relevance to some of the new communication demands
  * The Diverging Web: 1) Reference 2) Conversations
  * Where does News fit into that equation? It&#8217;s a bit of both 1 and 2
  * Conversation used to happen after publication. Now it&#8217;s instantaneous during event transpiration and after it
  * Media organizations can foster dialogue, feedback, and word of mouth right from the beginning
  * There is untapped potential within the conversation for user engagement, audience insights, monetization, and editorial workflow
  * The key is being able to process and understand massive amounts of data in real-time
  * Looking forward: New Interactions with News
  * Needs to be personalized based not just on explicit choices in user-profile forms, but also based on activities within one&#8217;s social network, viewing history, and editorial staffs&#8217; arbitrary judgment
  * Needs to be coming through in a real-time stream by people, objects, and the environment around us on new devices (mobile/standalone), platforms, and through new interaction options (touch, sensor based)
  * Needs to happen within new models for reporting. Not just articles from the media publisher, but also content from users, coming in real-time, and coming from sensors in the environment
