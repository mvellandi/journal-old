The value chain is the traditional business concept behind the first half of a product&#8217;s lifecycle. Problem is, it doesn&#8217;t show nor account for all the waste that&#8217;s really at the front-end of production, as Gregory Unruh explains in this interview with me. A lot of excess waste is the result, which poses a huge strain on natural capital, the environment, and business. The author of [&#8220;Earth Inc.&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422127176?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1422127176) goes on to discuss what the biosphere rules are, and how their implementation by businesses in the coming decade will result in better cost savings, increased economies of scale, and a smaller environmental impact.
