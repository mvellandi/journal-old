[Jon Kolko](http://www.austincenterfordesign.com/blog/?page_id=2) works at [frog design](http://www.frogdesign.com/) and is director of the [Austin Center for Design](http://www.austincenterfordesign.com/). In this presentation on experience, behavior, meaning, and culture, he brings together these four pillars in sometimes abstract and concrete ways, resulting in a principled foundation from which positive change can happen.

## Experience

An emotional & cognitive reaction to events that&#8217;s influenced by personal history, family/friends, culture, designed artifacts around us, and other people. It&#8217;s personal.

## Behavior

It&#8217;s the ability to affect massive and acute change. It&#8217;s the result of personal attitudes, motivations, environmental and social conditions. Through design research and empathy, we can influence change.

## Meaning

It&#8217;s a cumulative process of learning. Jon showed a process chart of:

__Data -> Info -> Knowledge -> Wisdom__

This common process is both reflective of learning in our personal lives, and in structured research. Sometimes instead of &#8220;wisdom&#8221;, I&#8217;ll use the word &#8220;intelligence&#8221; because it can be packaged nicely and supplemented with recommendations.

Between each stage, we&#8217;ll need to look at the pile we have and proceed to the next stage by using meaningful selection criteria, sensemaking, and empathy. Jon describes it all as:

> *&#8220;Design synthesis is an abductive sensemaking process of manipulating, organizing, pruning, and framing data in an effort to produce info and knowledge.&#8221;*

Abductive implies a hypothesis of &#8220;what can be&#8221;. Sensemaking describes the patterns you see, constraints you apply, mental models you form about your design problem. Framing is akin to cherrypicking personally relevant and meaningful observations (Note: recognize your bias and actively reframe if you&#8217;re the only researcher/conclusion gunslinger).

## Culture

Think of real-life scenarios. What can you observe in terms of conditions (environmental and social), actors, artifacts, behavior, cause and effect, constraints, motivators, available technology?

For as much research on conditions, need, and economic viability is helpful, unless we seek to understand human behavior and motivations, solutions will only be marginally effective and unsustainable.
