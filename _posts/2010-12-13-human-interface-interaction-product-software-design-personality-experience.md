Christopher Fahey is a founding partner and user experience director at  [Behavior](http://behaviordesign.com/). In this presentation, he discusses how our interactions with products and devices can be increasingly personal, as opposed to merely functional and sterile. This is due to human elements designed into the product, and can therefore be quite appealing. I particularly liked this presentation because from a marketing perspective, creating lovemarks with a brand is powerful stuff.

__Presentation Notes including personal interpretation:__

Although robots and artificial intelligence can be increasingly likeable through human features and attributes, there is a point where it/&#8221;they&#8221; become too lifelike or creepy. This is known as the [Uncanny Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley).

## __The Human Interface__

  1. about persuasion and seduction
  2. smart and has awareness
  3. physical, embodied
  4. linguistic, poetic, and narrative
  5. **emotional** and **feeling**

Don Norman in 2007 predicted next breakthroughs in user interface, reflecting a return to fundamentals with:

  1. **Command line languages** which represent advanced versions of old school operating systems which required typed in commands to perform actions. Except now instead of learning cryptic programming and operating languages, people can use natural language in typed or ideally spoken form. Ex: Google Voice for search commands.
  2. **Physicality**: the return to physical devices, where we control things by physical body movement, by turning moving, and manipulating appropriate mechanical devices like dials, levers, touch-screens, etc.

The Human Interface is:

  1. **Literally** about the ergonomics of the body and mind.
  2. **Metaphorically** about removing abstraction from interactions (more direct versus indirect interaction).

It&#8217;s not about **mimicking** human behavior, but **reflecting** it through the **system**.

Includes software that mirrors behavior, such as:

  1. Chat and Instant Message reflect communication immediacy.
  2. Social networks reflect the structure of relationships we value, from close to distant acquaintance [though I&#8217;d argue that effective relationship proximity differentiation mechanisms are very weak or non-existent in social networks today).
  3. Twitter reflects the semi-social &#8220;cocktail party&#8221; model of social interaction.

Well, what&#8217;s &#8220;human-ness&#8221;? Christopher Alexander identified [15 properties of living structures (detail)](http://www.truthtable.com/Fifteen_Princples.html).

Katherine Isbister classified characteristics of personhood:

  1. **External**: Bodies, faces, voices
  2. **Internal**: Agreeableness, Dominance, Openness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism

## Three Qualia of the Human Interface

__Sentience__

Ability to feel or perceive subjectively

The system is able to collect robust sensory data from the world, and make sense of that data

  1. Voice Recognition (words, gender, age, cultural background) for Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text applications
  2. Image and Face Recognition. Ex: webcams, Google Goggles
  3. Touchscreens
  4. Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect

Not all sensory data need to be robust to make extremely intelligent deductions from the data. Ex: [Fitbit system](http://www.fitbit.com/) for tracking fitness and sleep.

__Intimacy__

Quality of being close, comfortable, and familiar

The system can interface with humans extremely closely, up close and personal, and with our glad consent

Can be facilitated **with** and **through** machines by means of: emotional intelligence, proximity, presence, personal informatics, multiplayer games, real-time web, and&#8230;

  1. **Conversations** &#8211; In the context of designing user interfaces for facilitating conversations with other people, we should design features and affordances in the technology that support (and not hinder) healthy dialogue, just like in the real world in terms of politeness and such.
  2. **Identity** &#8211; User interfaces, profiles, and other designed elements representative of oneself, whether for personal or social purposes, should apply empathy and appropriate human dimensions in their design. A real life potential danger is that digital representations of ourselves may appear to shallow or too detailed, leading to an unfavorable public/private persona. For example, do Facebook or dating website profiles reflect the kind of person we want to project ourselves or perceived to be?

__Personality__

Sum of an individual person&#8217;s mental, emotional, behavioral, and social characteristics.

The system has a distinctive character, with recognizable human cultural and psychological behaviors

Various means of determining and assigning personality. Ex: [Myers-Briggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs), [Interpersonal Circumplex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_Circumplex)

  1. **Voice** in terms of content strategy: bubbly, conservative, dirty, friendly, cheeky, spiritual, serious, colloquial, formal, others
  2. **Characters** include culture and style in addition to personality. Design options: casting, product or attribute naming, personas, avatars, storytelling and themes.

Things to try:

  1. Use pronouns for your product: he, she
  2. Give your application a name
  3. Do more visceral prototypes, things that have weight and you can touch
  4. For ideas, collaborate with new disciplines and attend conferences in other fields
  5. Tell more stories! Bring character-driven screenwriting and dramaturgy to your experience design

## Danger and Opportunity

If we don&#8217;t **humanize** our products, they will **mechanize** us
