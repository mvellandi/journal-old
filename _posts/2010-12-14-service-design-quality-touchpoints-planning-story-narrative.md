Christian Palino of Adaptive Path gives this presentation on service design, and a particular approach by using film as inspiration.

__Dimensions__

  * Intangibility
  * Heterogeneity &#8211; The offering is different each time experienced
  * Inseparability &#8211; Production, delivery, consumption all happen in a set time, with overlapping begin/end times.
  * Perishability &#8211; The offering can&#8217;t be stored in inventory; it&#8217;s time dependent.

__Qualities__

  * Formal &#8211; Rational, rules-based, runs on a program; can often be evaluated based on these things.
  * Informal &#8211; Values, emotions, behaviors, myths and expectations, unprogrammed. Tend to be a lot less scripted and consistent.

__How can we&#8230;__

  * Design for the Informal?
  * Account for the human qualities in the service?
  * The mental and emotional variables that contribute to the experience?
  * Help shape the lasting impression of the service offering?

__Touchpoints__

  * Facilitate interactions with the service offering.
  * By themselves don&#8217;t communicate the value of the service, perhaps not even in their collective sum.
  * Although we can draw boxes and arrows to signify a customer journey model, that&#8217;s still just a meta model. However services are really terrible at following a linear progression; they&#8217;re inconsistent.
  * For simplicity sake though, in building potential narrative scenarios with defined touchpoints, what happens to the human variables? Can values, emotions, expectations, and behaviors be scripted?
  * What happens in abuse scenarios, where the service is used in unanticipated or unintended ways?

__Planning for Service__

  * So if services are intangible, instance unique, ever-changing, and temporal, then the value of creating fixed plans for services can be highly overrated.
  * General Eisenhower once said, *&#8220;Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.&#8221;*
  * [ME: This brings up in dynamic service delivery with employee actors, the concept of the &#8220;General&#8217;s Intent&#8221;, where the desired outcome is known by everyone, and they&#8217;re allowed to bend service rules and protocols to meet objectives.]

__Designing for Informal Qualities__

  * Film Montage as an inspirational source.
  * We need to consider the string of touchpoints and the space between.
  * We&#8217;re already using storyboards; other sources?
  * Improvisation. It&#8217;s a bit hard to design for because it&#8217;s intangible, hard to evaluate, and hard to capture.
  * [ME: defining core objective, fixed and flexible rules, protocols, dynamic affordances that are invisible to normal, observed, service delivery and experience.]
  * What about structure in services?
  * Dramatic structure &#8211; an organic codification; thesis, antithesis, synthesis; Arcs.
