[Michael Wesch](http://ksuanth.weebly.com/wesch.html), Associate Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Kansas State University, demonstrates using examples from anthropological fieldwork in Papua New Guinea, YouTube, university classrooms, and “the future,” the profound yet often unnoticed ways in which media “mediate” our culture.

__Presentation Notes__

  * Media are not just tools nor means of communication
  * Media **mediate** relationships
  * So when media changes, relationships change
  * [Lee Rainie&#8217;s](http://pewinternet.com/Experts/Lee-Rainie.aspx) effects of new media, within the context of the printing press
      1. Role of experts is challenged by newly empowered voices
      2. New institutions emerge to deal with changes
      3. Struggle to revise social and legal norms
      4. Concepts of identity and community multiply and transform
      5. New forms of language arise
  * Look at how television&#8217;s effect on families and reshaping the &#8220;living&#8221; room, oftentimes the &#8220;dining&#8221; room: moving around furniture to face the television set.
  * [Neil Postman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman) in 1985 noted that the conversations of our culture happen in television, are controlled by few, designed for the masses, always entertaining (even serious ones), and the resulting conversations create a culture of irrelevance, incoherence, and impotence (a feeling of being unable to affect change in national and world affairs, social problems and welfare, on which now we&#8217;re being informed through news media).
  * Indifference is a common individual reaction to and cultural aspect of people&#8217;s exposure to the wide variety of information they absorb and process in life. It&#8217;s normal and to be expected with increased exposure.

> _&#8220;In the midst of a fabulous array of historically unprecedented and utterly mind-boggling stimuli&#8230;whatever&#8221;

> &#8211; [Thomas de Zengotita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_de_Zengotita)_

  * &#8220;Whatever&#8221; was pre-1960s a response indicating &#8220;that&#8217;s what I meant.&#8221; Late 60s and afterward, was a popular response to indicate &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&#8221; [man]. Then in the 1990s &#8220;whatever&#8221; along with &#8220;meh&#8221;, became a response of indifference.
  * MTV Generation&#8217;s attributes (as found in 3rd party opinion): short attention spans, materialistic, narcissistic, not easily impressed. Why? Because they&#8217;re bombarded with a wide variety of interesting media.
  * Kurt Cobain of grunge rock band Nirvana wrote in the song &#8220;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#8221;, the words &#8220;I find it hard, It&#8217;s hard to find, oh well, whatever, nevermind.&#8221;
  * The media environment at the time was disempowering; was still a one-way conversation. You had to be on TV to have a voice, to be significant. Reality television shows that started to emerge, and still to this day, fulfilled perhaps a desire for viewers to see everyday people on television, in a variety of structured thematic programming, whether viewers related to characters or not.
  * In the late 90s to present day: &#8220;Whatever. I&#8217;ll do what I want.&#8221; Embodies self-importance and independence.
  * Author Jean Twinge of &#8220;[Generation Me](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743276981?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743276981)&#8220;, did research on how although young Americans are more assertive and feel empowered, they&#8217;re also more miserable and anxiety prone. If reality television and contest shows like American Idol are providing the feeling of self-importance, empowerment and possibility, then it&#8217;s a natural result that many people will feel discouraged and disappointed when they realize their skills and talent are just mediocre or possibly poor. Michael refers to the Quarter-Life crisis phenomena, described in some self-help books today, as the discovery one is just not as awesome as one thought one is.
  * These key moments are developmentally important in people&#8217;s lives when they&#8217;re are looking for identity and recognition, in a culture where these two things are not givens. The interesting thing about today&#8217;s society is that you have to find them, earn, and create them. And that&#8217;s seen as challenging.
  * There are movements brewing to awaken people on the dangers of striving for and expecting &#8220;greatness&#8221;.

    Ex: [Dove Campaign for Real Beauty](http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/)
  * So given the new media environment with social networking, creative media production & sharing, blogging, what now?

> _&#8220;We look at the present through a rear-view mirror.<br /> We march backwards into the future.&#8221;

Michael shares a video he created to represent the phenomena:

[Video Link for Email/Other Subscribers &#8211; 4.5min](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE)

  * Network of creation, sharing, collaborative filtering, organization, distribution
  * Matters because new media isn&#8217;t controlled by the few; not on-way; created by, for, and around networks not masses; and transform individual pursuits into collective action.
  * Why might this **deeply** matter though?
      1. We know ourselves through our relations with others.
      2. New media create new ways of relating to others.
      3. And it&#8217;ll create new ways of knowing ourselves.
  * Michael discusses YouTube statistics showing most videos are personal; for popular ones, many folks like to do remixes; and that over 20k videos everyday are addressed to the YouTube &#8220;community&#8221;. Why?
  * We&#8217;re in a 6 decade long decline in &#8220;community&#8221;, as documented by authors like Robert Putnam in &#8220;[Bowling Alone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743203046?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743203046)&#8220;. Consider the increase in suburbanism, big box retailing, and mass/diverse broadcast media, among many other factors.
  * There&#8217;s a degree of **cultural inversion** going on:
      1. **Express**: Individualism, Independence, Commercialization
      2. **Value**: Community, Relationships, Authenticity
  * Anonymity + Physical Distance + Rare & Ephemeral Dialogue = Freedom to Experience Humanity without Fear or Anxiety
  * There&#8217;s also a degree of **cultural tension** now though. Connection to others is sometimes perceived as a constraint, sometimes as an opportunity to act without restraint. An example is the ability for people to **not** share things with close family and friends, but feel free to do so with distant acquaintances and the general public through text/video diary entries.
      1. Media do not just distance us
      2. They connect us in different ways
      3. That can sometimes feel distant
      4. But sometimes that distance allows us to connect more deeply than ever before
      5. And new forms of community create new forms of self-understanding
  * Video is also powerful for advocacy. Greenpeace made a spoof of Dove&#8217;s real beauty ad, highlighting deforestation in Indonesia to make palm oil, used in Dove (Unilever) products (among many other product categories, and many other manufacturers around the world by the way). Within a few weeks of airing, Unilever had met with Greenpeace and agreed on specific measures. In another similar case, Greenpeace did a video on KitKat chocolate wafers by Nestle, also resulting in discussions.
  * Think beyond user experience design, and consider designing the possibilities for human connection.
  * Composer Eric Whitacre saw a video of a lady singing a song of his on YouTube, then organized a [virtual choir of 183 people to sing  a song together](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7o7BrlbaDs).
  * Kenyan election violence in 2007 resulted in 4 people creating [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com/), a platform for citizen-reporting on various events (good/bad/neutral). [SwiftRiver](http://swift.ushahidi.com/), the underlying open-source platform, has since then been used in response to crises in Haiti, Chile, Russia, and other nations.
  * Interestingly, these platforms are using [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) because they represent the most current and accurate maps available, as contributed and updated by individuals.
