We&#8217;ve moved into an era where the gadgets we use affect our very being. Purpose-built medical devices are moving into the hands of consumers, and apps deliver healthcare over-the-air. [Gretchen Anderson of Punchcut](http://www.punchcut.com/) looks at key concerns and best practices when designing medical devices and motivating healthy behaviors.

The health and medical product market offers society meaningful solutions to real problems. The most important attributes are effectiveness and reliability, followed by ergonomics and simplicity as secondary factors to product success. While these are surely important, these merely address functionality. They don&#8217;t motivate people to act or use the products, which is especially important to preventative care. The entire onus is on the user to be responsible and use the products at the appropriate times and manners as prescribed by a doctor, or simply perceived as reasonable.

Also, we&#8217;re now entering an era where electronic medical devices offer advanced data networking capabilities through mobile technology and software. Gretchen makes a good point that medical companies increasingly need industrial designers with consumer electronics experience, and interaction designers for the extended user-experiences that encourage active usage and holistic health.
