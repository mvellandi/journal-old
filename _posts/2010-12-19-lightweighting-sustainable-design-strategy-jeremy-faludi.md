Lightweighting involves optimizing your design&#8217;s geometry and structure so that it uses less material. Products made with less material have less negative environmental impact, all the way from production to disposal. Jeremy Faludi of Stanford University introduces the subject in this episode. [Visit the website](http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=sustainable_course&course_id=2) to see 3 additional installments on lightweighting, in addition to resources and case studies.
