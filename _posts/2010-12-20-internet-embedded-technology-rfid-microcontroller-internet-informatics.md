Although I didn&#8217;t attend the [MIT CIO Summit 2010](http://www.mitcio.com/index.php), there is a free registration to watch their various videos online. Here&#8217;s the notes I made on the presentation on the Internet of Things.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;

[RFID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID) was the big hope for logistics, supply chain management, informatics, and other purposes in the early 2000s. Cost per tag was a big factor to widespread adoption potential. 5 cents was the generally agreed price needed. Originally, tags would ideally carry data. But the cost target was met by giving tags ID numbers, and letting the information reside on the internet instead.

Connecting inanimate objects to the internet was the smallest of challenges; the technology was there. Rather it was getting people to deal with systems where objects automatically connected to the network. Business processes change, but getting people to change behaviors and operate in this new world is a far greater challenge. Example: Re-design buildings&#8217; HVAC systems and conduct diagnostics remotely. It would save money, energy, and be smarter. But it would also bring up issues regarding existing job security issues for building maintenance staff and associated infrastructure services. These people&#8217;s livelihood involves a distinct set of routine tasks based on a knowledge bank. To try and disrupt that will cause a sensible pushback.

The original vision was to see, track, and manage the invisible objects around us. GPS, RFID, and related technologies (existing and new) are part of this vision. The low hanging fruit for tagging nowadays is asset tracking.

Although we can design intelligent systems, we have to design them for real humans, by taking behavioral economics and choice architecture into mind. There is a desire for simple, seamless, thoughtless, permission based services to automatically make decisions for us based on parameters we set and can adjust. Example: A home using less energy based on settings for dynamic lifestyle needs. Perhaps based on budget, time of day, season, occupancy level. At the moment, we&#8217;re willing to tolerate utility bills that simply give us an amount to pay. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re used to. But we wouldn&#8217;t do that with grocery bills, buying a car, or other multi-attribute based products and services.

**Long-term growth opportunities in the internet**:

**Tech**: video, mobile, embedded technology

**Sectors**: energy, healthcare, education

**Embedded information systems**:

Tags, batteries, [microcontrollers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontrollers), readers,  web software objects as accessible interfaces.

10-15 billion microcontrollers are shipped every year, most of them aren&#8217;t networked. That&#8217;s where the &#8220;internet of things&#8221; opportunity lies.

**Predicted applications quickly up and coming?**

  * Automotive
  * Human health (medical and personal fitness)
  * Home security

**Biggest opportunity?**

B2C****

**Biggest barriers?**

  * People not being able to envision opportunity beyond existing systems and perceived constraints.
  * Standards and complexity.
  * Readiness and stability of applicable ecosystem.

**Biggest talent issue?**

  * Not enough people like Steve Jobs
  * Domain expertise for specific industries, scenarios, and applications.
  * People & organizations that can envision and design end-to-end user experiences.

**Biggest fear?**

  * It&#8217;ll take a long time.
  * Non-intelligent consumer adoption and use.
  * Immediate distortion and privacy issues.
  * A new security paradigm.

**Biggest excitement?**

  * Good that it&#8217;ll do; Energy is the big opportunity.
  * Benefit to individuals.
  * Quantum leap in efficiency
