In going through my books lately, I came across [The Traveler&#8217;s Gift](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785273220?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0785273220). It&#8217;s a heartwarming tale where the main character, being sad and getting in an accident, travels time to meet mostly famous world leaders who impart important life principles to live by. Summarized, here they are. I purposely leave them brief for self-reflection:

  1. By accepting responsibility for my past, I free myself to move into a bigger, brighter future of my own choosing.
  2. I will seek wisdom from media and friends that&#8217;ll bring positive change and healthy beliefs in myself and my future.
  3. I am a person of action. Doing nothing and dwelling is not an option.
  4. I have a decided heart. I am passionate about my vision for the future. My course is charted and my destiny is assured.
  5. Today I will choose to be happy. I will greet each day with laughter and smile at every person met. I am the possessor of a grateful spirit.
  6. I will greet this day with Forgiveness to myself for any previous pain, and to all others who unjustly criticize or don&#8217;t not ask to be forgiven.
  7. I will continue despite exhaustion and focus on results. I am a person of great faith. I will persist without exception.
