Andrew Ruben, former VP of Strategy & Sustainability at Wal-Mart Stores, gives this neat talk on the importance of operational fitness with regards to sustainability. Positing that supply chains have been opaque to this day and that information technology and research allows people to see the combined environmental impact of the products they buy, we&#8217;re all going to be naked someday. When that day comes, organizations would be better off looking fit (environmentally/socially responsible and innovative) rather than pudgy and dated.
