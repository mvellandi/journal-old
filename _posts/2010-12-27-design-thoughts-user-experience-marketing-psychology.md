**Simple. Relevant. Elegant.**

This video includes quotes from famous designers and agency associates on the meaning of Design. The inspirational lesson for professionals of all design and marketing disciplines, is that the user experience is all that matters. There&#8217;s a LOT of psychology going on here. I don&#8217;t care whether you&#8217;re designing a fancy toaster or a quarterly presentation on a department&#8217;s performance and goals, damn it, persuade others to like you. Help them make good decisions because we&#8217;re just human after all, and we need guidance. Delight us. Don&#8217;t overburden us. Give us just the info we need. Do this, and we&#8217;ll trust you. Even if this particular offer doesn&#8217;t quite appeal to me. You respected my time. And gave me reason to possibly reconsider or recommend you to others.

That&#8217;s one way of looking at a user-provider dialogue 🙂
