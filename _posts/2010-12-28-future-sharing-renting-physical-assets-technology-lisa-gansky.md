Technology entrepreneur [Lisa Gansky](http://twitter.com/instigating) believes that the growing ubiquity of networked information and relationships are leading to what she calls a ‚Äúmesh‚Äù economy of shared services and products. She is the author of [&#8220;The Mesh: Why the Future of Business is Sharing&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843715?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591843715), a great book I recently read. What follows is a combined summary, along with my own thoughts for meaningful synthesis. Her book is highly recommended, and provides much greater context, more topics and stories, and a landscape view that my mere notes below can&#8217;t provide.

__Notes__

  * Marketplaces like eBay and Craigslist enabled greater access for P2P sales and purchases.
  * We&#8217;ve already grown used to the possibility of renting or freely streaming digital content (i.e. Netflix, Pandora, iTunes, Amazon).
  * Also, we have libraries and online exchanges for low value items (i.e. [Bookmooch](http://bookmooch.com/)).
  * Opportunity: **Sharing/leasing platforms for high value, low-utilized physical assets**.

  * There&#8217;s a LOT of physical assets and experiences that people would like to participate in, yet cannot for financial and practical limitations. Look around for these resources that could be more efficiently & profitably shared using social networks. Then ask how might you reduce the burdens of ownership like financing, insurance, maintenance, storage, and disposal.
  * Non-ownership and commons mentality allows for greater asset utilization, financial opportunity (savings/revenue), social benefits, and less material produced, sitting idle, and in some cases sent to landfill.
  * Economics after all is a dynamic interplay of resource supply and demand, where information is the marketplace enabler.
  * The global economic downturn, increased resource pressures, personal re-considerations of what&#8217;s valuable in our lives (experiences, community, savings/retirement), and increasing population densities are drivers.
  * The growing (and relatively new) consumer model allows for more choices, tools, info, and actionability.
  * [Zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com/) is one example that through IT systems manages car locations, cleanliness, partner relations, and driver profiles.
  * Like Amazon and eBay, more users and data make an improved service that better scales and serves customer needs.
  * How do we make sharing irresistible? Trade less stuff for more experiences.
  * **Enabling aspects:** cloud computing, 3rd party logistics, smartphones, user profiles, situational state awareness, enhanced data collection, SMS, payment services.
  * With entrepreneurs that provide these valuable opportunities, we can see large numbers of new participants skip the concept of &#8220;ownership&#8221;, just like most of China went straight to digital cameras, India skipping landlines and going straight to mobile.
  * A second opportunity is for using what we already have, more effectively.
  * Peer to Peer carsharing is another example, that takes advantage of the fact that owned cars are used only 8% of the time in the U.S. Companies include [RelayRides](http://relayrides.com/), [Spride](http://spride.com/), and [WhipCar](http://www.whipcar.com/).
  * Pop-Up Stores is one retail concept that temporarily rents building space.
  * [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/) and [Roomorama](http://roomorama.com/) enable P2P renting of rooms, apartments, houses, bungalows, houseboats, estates, and castles. [KeyWiFi](http://www.keywifi.com/) allows people to rent out their own WiFi connection, and identify 5 hotspots they&#8217;d like to use.
  * [Zopa](http://uk.zopa.com/ZopaWeb/), [Prosper](http://www.prosper.com/), [Lending Club](http://www.lendingclub.com/), [Smava](http://www.smava.de/) loan money.
  * [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) funds big projects.
  * From a cradle to cradle perspective, value = unused waste.
  * This creates opportunities for reverse value chains and secondary markets like [ThredUp](http://thredup.com/) (kids clothing/toys), [RecycleMatch](http://www.recyclematch.com/) (secondary materials), [RecycleBank](http://www.recyclebank.com/) (compensated consumer recycling system), and products from [Rickshaw Bags](http://www.rickshawbags.com/), [Advinylize](http://advinylize.com/), and [Terracycle](http://www.terracycle.net/). The craft market is also thriving. [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) is a popular example.
  * Curator and Word of Mouth effect of social networks and peer review sites, allows for great marketing. But brand participation has to be authentic.
  * The Mesh allows entrepreneurs and ventures to quickly define, refine, and scale their business. The opportunity for low investment and getting quick service feedback is phenomenal. This allows businesses to refine their offerings before they scale up their operations, thus creating less potential waste.
  * Visit [http://Meshing.it](http://meshing.it/) for a few examples of more companies. Note: I went through the site and saw a few organizations that have no innovative qualities, and just self-contributed their site to the directory.

Big thanks to Lisa for doing the research, compilation, and synthesis of this important economic, social, and environmental opportunity üôÇ
