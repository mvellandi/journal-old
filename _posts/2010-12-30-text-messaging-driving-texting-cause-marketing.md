Looks like a favorite cause of mine has reached new heights. I knew cell phone carriers had some form of education/cause programs available, as early in 2010 I saw a freeway billboard from Verizon with a short PSA (public service announcement) message regarding texting. Well, here&#8217;s a documentary video from AT&T that was uploaded on Dec.20th and now has ~335,580 views at the time of this post late night Dec.29th.

And here&#8217;s another one from phone manufacturer LG that has comedian actress Jane Lynch in a series of 8 videos (on YouTube) that are meant to amuse and enlighten on the subject. Having started their campaign 4 months ago, they have a view total of ~28,000.

Okay, from viewership statistics alone, there&#8217;s two conclusions to be drawn from AT&T&#8217;s high numbers: they have a great digital PR team, and/or the documentary film is compelling. For one, the video was featured on [Engadget.com](http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/27/atandt-releases-dramatic-anti-texting-while-driving-documentary) which gave it a lot of exposure. Secondly though, there are real life people telling their stories of how texting & driving had affected their lives. After watching it, I think you&#8217;d agree. We can best relate to what&#8217;s authentic, especially when the consequences of the subject matter can be so grave.
