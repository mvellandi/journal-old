Sean Gourley is a mathematician who has spent the last seven years using math to understand war and insurgency. He is now applying that understanding at [Quid Inc.](http://quid.com/) to develop ways to map technology companies – in search of the “technology genome.”

There&#8217;s a variety of innovative startups happening like [23andme.com](https://www.23andme.com/) that exhibit multiple attributes, wherein classifying and comparing them is difficult. To begin better understanding organizations, they begin with a &#8220;Related Document Group&#8221; which includes attributes regarding news announcements, research papers, social media, industry publication mentions, web pages, legal findings, job listings, and patents. With RDGs of various companies, they then extract &#8220;genes&#8221; of what makes the individual orgs unique, since not all entity attributes are important.

So Quid is growing fast, gathering a lot of data on more than 21k entities, from which they&#8217;ve mapped out 28k technology genes. Analysis can get really interesting when comparing massive numbers of organizations against various genes to see how similar/dissimilar they are, even dynamically building network maps, potentially answering &#8220;What does technology innovation look like today?&#8221;
