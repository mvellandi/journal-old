Nick Bilton, Lead Technology Reporter for [The New York Times “Bits” blog](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/), says that digital media has resulted in a &#8220;new form of storytelling.&#8221; Bilton, who is also a designer and user interface specialist, is co-founder of NYC Resistor, a hacker collective in Brooklyn, and has written a book called, [I Live in the Future: & Here’s How It Works](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307591115?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307591115). The video is entertaining and I do recommend watching it.

__Presentation Notes__

  * Describes some interesting projects including visualizing home v. mobile content readership across the U.S. on a map, investigating and developing content for alternative reading devices including tablets, and flexible displays.
  * Everyone that gets a newspaper essentially gets &#8220;dumb content&#8221;, since it doesn&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve read, your history, etc. Digital experiences have the opportunity to know you better, and better display relevant content across devices.
  * We can effectively multitask for many, but not all things in life. [The Brodmann Area 10 of the brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_10) is said according to research that &#8220;it is involved in strategic processes in memory retrieval and executive function. During human evolution, the functions in this area resulted in its expansion relative to the rest of the brain.&#8221; And it&#8217;s believed to develop and perform faster in future human generations as our activities may require more cognitive and physical task multitasking at various times.
  * &#8220;Technocondria&#8221; is a term he coined regarding fear of technology, and describes how people have feared locomotives at one time, with some amusing anecdotes.
  * So why are we multitasking more? Well, there are increased number of interfaces in our lives, through which we&#8217;re choosing to do various activities that we find interesting or necessary for interacting with phases in Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs.
  * Secondly, there&#8217;s a lot more media around us to consume and peruse, should we so desire.
  * Nick describes a slice of media usage history including pocket sized books centuries ago that allowed people to conveniently read/learn on the go. Radio&#8217;s introduction showed a very attentive human behavior at first, but over time as more broadcasts and programming came over the air, people began multitasking while listening along because they didn&#8217;t have enough time in the day to do chores in the house, read newspapers or books.
  * Television then comes along and follows a similar adoption curve, although more attention time is paid because of the visual element. Radio is then made available in the car for listen to while driving. What we end up with over time is media and multitasking.
  * Our brains and habits are adapting, but obviously it&#8217;s not evolution which requires much longer time lapse. Nick provides 3rd party research studies showing this.
  * Video games are also responsible for multitasking capability development in terms of attention, hand & eye coordination, working and long-term memory, and visual & spatial problem solving.
  * Jumping back to newspapers, the common discussion is around business models. Let&#8217;s look at how radically our interactions with news is changing, from reading on mobile devices and sharing with others (family/friends/acquaintance web).
  * Changes: Relevance (ability to tune in and out of meaningful content), Location (anywhere), Trust (less trust in media, more trust in friends), Who Reports News (journalists, new contributors), Feedback and Discussion (comments, sharing).
  * The new generation is learning to consume, create, and aggregate media. That&#8217;s going to have an increasing impact on how news organizations report, tell and consume stories.

**Personal Notes:** Although these sociological changes are afoot and do affect our relationships and interactions with media, the extent to which we participate varies just as it has throughout time. Some people love consuming and sharing media, other folks like to spend much more time on other activities meaningful or important to them (sports, family, nature, hobbies, volunteering, games&#8230;). This relates to how much free time we have, the stage of life we&#8217;re in, the amount of responsibilities we have. Nonetheless, I&#8217;d like to think that intermittently we all have an outside world situational awareness curiosity. That competes though with the awesome ability we&#8217;ll have to take photos on the go with a smartphone, do video chat with friends and family, play a game, or something else in those little break times in between train stations, on vacation, or whatever the situation allows. For the sake of mankind, I hope we choose to be more present and put the device down.
