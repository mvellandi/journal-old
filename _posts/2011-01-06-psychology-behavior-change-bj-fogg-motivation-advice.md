Great list from [Stanford University&#8217;s Persuasive Technology Lab](http://captology.stanford.edu/). See my notes for each point below the slides.

Great list! Here are my thoughts on each:

1. Relying on willpower for long term change

Willpower is temporary energy. You&#8217;ll need deep rooted values and personal aspirations to sustain that energy. But drive alone is not enough. We need direction, otherwise we&#8217;ll get burnt out. And if the change requires a lot of exerted effort (cognitive, emotional, big time slots), we&#8217;ll lose inertia. So forget about willpower, and rely on aspiration and values for energy. Focus then on direction, and the path.

2. Attempting big leaps instead of baby steps

Some folks can be REALLY motivated and ready to commit to big change, including dropping strong attachments and habits. But they&#8217;re exceptionally rare. Just like in life where we overestimate difficulty and temporarily forget about habits, obligations, and realistic constraints (time, money, access, other), big leaps are naive and have demoralizing after effects. Seek and achieve little successes, and iterate.

3. Ignoring how environment shapes behaviors

You&#8217;ve probably heard the old wisdom nugget about the friends we choose and spend time with say a lot about ourselves. Well, it&#8217;s kind of the same for behavior. How can a person expect to lose weight through exercise unless they concurrently decide to change the food in their kitchen, and not eat big portions like family members, roommates, and peers? How can a very messy desk not influence a person&#8217;s feeling of self-control and being &#8220;caught up&#8221; (completion)? Changing the context can greatly promote desired behaviors.

4. Trying to stop old behaviors instead of creating new ones

Stop thinking about tattooed elephants wearing bandannas!
Trying to stop bad activity through cessation alone is unsustainable. We need to focus on what works. For example, bad personal habits and moping around depressed are usually handled by doing something else instead, like chores, exercise, and other activities. Focus on action, not avoidance.

5. Blaming failures on lack of motivation

Just like #1, willpower and drive alone don&#8217;t cause failures. Look at the the environment, the number of tasks and the effort required for each, the directions given, goals established, and obstacles hindering progress..

6. Underestimating the power of triggers.

Triggers are codified response points in space and time, often based on conditional situations. Like all in life, good behavior has a beginning and end. Direction implies not only goals, but timing as well..

7. Believing that information leads to action.

General information produces awareness. Great information will also stimulate desire, call upon people&#8217;s values, and provide direction. Although I&#8217;ve diversely defined &#8220;information&#8221;, sociological and environmental conditions like peer pressure and path design are quite influential when it comes to action.

8. Focusing on abstract goals more than concrete behaviors.

Goals can be big or small. Their achievement relies on carrying out the behavior(s). But the bigger the goal is, the less intuitive people are in what needs to be done. Define and execute. Iterate. Progress check. Continue.

9. Seeking to change a behavior forever, not for a short time.

Similar to #2, but with an absolutistic mindset. The harder the change is, the more resistance people will display. If they don&#8217;t live up to the high behavioral expectation, then they&#8217;ll be demoralized and perhaps feel shame. Not a good situation to set up. Focus perhaps instead on short time period in terms of what&#8217;s actionable now and within the next week or three months..

10. Assuming that behavior change is difficult

Difficulty is a qualitative judgment of effort required based on task/behavior requirements versus our capabilities. No matter what&#8217;s being asked of people, if it&#8217;s rational, desirable, and people are motivated, with a clear and sensible process, behavioral change is possible.
