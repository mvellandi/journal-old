Great message from [Noah Brier](http://www.noahbrier.com/). The slideshow below reviews long term trends in media, marketing, and communications. This post&#8217;s headline says it all though. We can create content and media galore, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;ll attract a lot of views and personal or brand affinity. Indeed most content produced online is personal. So the point is that creating lots of media and content to share should **not** be the goal. Experiment, focus on a niche, and iterate past successes. One more thing which I&#8217;ll add though. Differentiate through emotionally appealing photos, video, and interaction design. But set the aesthetic bar very high, and you&#8217;ll practically be untouchable.
