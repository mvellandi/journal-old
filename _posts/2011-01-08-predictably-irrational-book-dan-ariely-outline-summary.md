*&#8220;&#8230;use social, cognitive and emotional factors in understanding the economic decisions of individuals and institutions performing economic functions, including consumers, borrowers and investors, and their effects on market prices, returns and the resource allocation. The fields are primarily concerned with the bounds of rationality (selfishness, self-control) of economic agents. Behavioral models typically integrate insights from psychology with neo-classical economic theory.&#8221;*

Here are the chapter notes, as [written by Chris Yeh](http://bookoutlines.pbworks.com/w/page/14422685/Predictably-Irrational) with some editing and additions of my own:

## Influencing Decisions by Adding Inferior Choices

In considering options before deciding, we always seek to draw comparisons, and we are often unaware as to how seemingly irrelevant factors such as the simple presentation of options (like timing), actually influence what we select.

Given three choices:

  * A
  * B (very distinct, but equally as attractive as A)
  * A- (similar to A, but inferior)

We will almost always choose A, because it is clearly superior to A-.

Say we are trying to decide on a vacation between two choices:

  * Paris trip with free breakfast
  * Rome trip with free breakfast

We cannot decide between the two because maybe we love Paris and Rome equally.

But adding the option of a slightly lower priced Paris trip but without the free breakfast, the better Paris option now looks a lot better, and marketers have artificially created a premium offering, and distracted us from the Rome option.

So by adding a third option (an &#8220;A minus&#8221; version of one of the options), we&#8217;ll pick the A version, over the equally attractive B version.

**Example:** When Williams-Sonoma introduced bread machines, sales were slow. When they added a _deluxe_ version that was 50% more expensive, they started flying off the shelves. The first bread machine now appeared to be a bargain.

## Fallacy of Supply and Demand

Anchoring, the act of creating or adopting an attachment, has a major long-term effect on our willingness to pay.

Herding: Assuming that something is good (or bad) on the basis of other people&#8217;s previous behavior.

**Example:** Starbucks itself is a case of producing a new anchor.  Howard Schultz made Starbucks as different as possible from the traditional coffee shop to convince shoppers to establish a new anchor, rather than saying, &#8220;This is a fancy, expensive Dunkin Donuts.&#8221;

Knowing the impact of anchoring, you should train yourself to question your repeated behaviors.  You should also pay particular attention to the first decision in a long stream of decisions.  It may seem like it is just one decision, but that first decision may have impact on future decisions for years to come.

The bigger picture is that supply and demand are not independent; supply-side variables like MSRP can impact willingness to pay.  Price &#8220;memory&#8221; can also have a major impact. Doubling the price of milk and halving the price of wine would have a major short-term impact, but it&#8217;s unlikely to have a long-term impact on consumption patterns. And if you induced amnesia about the previous prices, it might have nearly no impact at all.

## &#8220;Free&#8221; Drives a Lot More Demand than a Penny

Why we often pay too much (in opportunity cost or time spent) when we pay nothing.

Zero/free is a source of irrational excitement.  This is called the &#8220;zero price effect.&#8221;

Ariely, Shampanier, and Mazar conducted an experiment using Lindt truffles and Hershey&#8217;s Kisses.

  * When a truffle was $0.15 and a Kiss was $0.01, 73% of subjects chose the truffle and 27% the Kiss.
  * When a truffle was $0.14 and a Kiss was free, 69% chose the kiss and 31% the truffle.

According to standard economic theory, the price reduction shouldn&#8217;t lead to any behavior change (relative price and expected pleasure should be equal between the two experiments).

The same experiments were conducted with Kisses going for $0.02, $0.01, and free&#8230;and free again made a huge difference.

Ariely&#8217;s theory is that for normal transactions, we consider both upside and downside. But when something is free, we forget about the downside.

&#8220;Free&#8221; makes us perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is.

  * Humans are loss-averse; when considering a normal purchase, loss-aversion comes into play.
  * But when an item is free, there is no visible possibility of loss.

**Example:** Amazon&#8217;s free shipping

  * After Super Saver shipping was introduced, Amazon saw sales increases everywhere except for France.
  * It turned out that the French division offered 1 franc ($0.20) pricing instead of free pricing.
  * When this was changed to free, France saw the same sales increases as elsewhere.

**Example:** People will wait in line for absurdly long times to get something for free.

Free is one of the most powerful ways to trigger behavior.

## The Cost of Social Norms

Why we are Happy to do things, but Not when we are Paid to do them.

Clark, Mills, and Fiske theorize that we live in two worlds; one where social norms prevail, and another where market norms make the rules.

  * Social norms such as reciprocity are warm and fuzzy, with no explicit quid pro quo.
  * Market norms are explicit and hard&#8211;you get what you pay for.

**Example:** The AARP asked lawyers to participate in a program where they would offer their services to needy employees for a discounted price of $30/hour. No dice. When the program manager instead asked if they&#8217;d offer their services for free, the lawyers overwhelmingly said they would participate.

  * Conclusion: Market norms drive out social norms.

*&#8220;People are willing to work free, and they are willing to work for a reasonable wage, but offer them just a small payment and they will walk away.&#8221;*

Companies that try to market based on social norms (&#8220;like a good neighbor&#8230;&#8221;) but fail to follow through (e.g. like imposing nuisance fees), end up in a worse position. Consumers take personal offense when a relationship framed as a social exchange turns out to be a market one. This is one of the risks and consequences to be wary of when employing social marketing. __

*&#8220;If you&#8217;re a company, you can&#8217;t have it both ways. You can&#8217;t treat your customers like family one moment and then treat them impersonally (or worse, as a nuisance or competitor) a moment later when this becomes more convenient or profitable. This is not how social relationships work. If you want a social relationship, go for it, but remember that you have to maintain it under all circumstances.&#8221;*

If you think you need to play rough, don&#8217;t waste money making your company the fuzzy feel-good choice. State what you give and what you expect in return&#8211;it&#8217;s just business.

*&#8220;If companies want to benefit from the advantages of social norms, they need to do a better job of cultivating those norms&#8230;.It&#8217;s remarkable how much work companies (particularly start-ups) can get out of people when social norms (such as the excitement of building something together) are stronger than market norms (such as salaries stepping up with each promotion). If corporations started thinking in terms of social norms, they would realize that these norms build loyalty and&#8211;more important&#8211;make people want to extend themselves to the degree that corporations need today: to be flexible, concerned, and willing to pitch in.  That&#8217;s what a social relationship delivers.&#8221;*

*&#8220;A salary alone will not motivate people to risk their lives. Police officers, firefighters, soldiers&#8211;they don&#8217;t die for their weekly pay. It&#8217;s the social norms&#8211;pride in their profession and a sense of duty&#8211;that will motivate them to give up their lives and health.&#8221;*

*&#8220;Money, as it turns out, is very often the most expensive way to motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but often more effective as well.&#8221;*

## Influence of Arousal

Why __Hot__ Is Much Hotter Than We Realize

Ariely and Loewenstein conducted an experiment on Berkeley undergrads (Ariely tried to do this at MIT, but couldn&#8217;t get the necessary permissions).  They asked them a series of questions, then had the undergraduates stimulate themselves to a state of sexual arousal, and asked them to answer the same set of questions. The results show that people simply don&#8217;t realize how different their decision-making is during a state of arousal.

Implication: Someone may promise to just say NO, but that promise is less likely to hold up during a state of emotional excitement.

## Procrastination and Self-Control

*&#8220;We have problems with self-control, related to immediate and delayed gratification. But each of these problems has potential self-control mechanisms. If we can&#8217;t save from our paycheck, we can take advantage of our employer&#8217;s automatic deduction option; if we don&#8217;t have the will to exercise regularly alone, we can make an appointment to exercise in the company of our friends. These are tools that we can commit to in advance, and they may help us be the kind of people we want to be.&#8221;*

How can these principles be used to improve health care?

Charge a $100 deposit, refundable when the patient shows up on time rather than procrastinating.

**Repackage procedures so that they are predictable and easily done.**

**Example:**

  * Ford had issues getting customers to come in for regular maintenance. Many of the parts needed servicing at different times, and the intervals differed by vehicle.
  * Then Ford noticed that Honda had lumped all service needs into one of three intervals: 6 months/5,000 miles, 1 year/10,000 miles, and 2 years/25,000 miles. It was suboptimal from an engineering standpoint, but it made it easy to tell customers when to come in.
  * Ford imitated Honda, and within 3 years, was achieving the same results.
  * Why not make comprehensive physicals simple?  Then layer in a financial penalty for missing them.

What about a self-control credit card that let you decide in advance on certain restrictions on your spending? (Only $60/month on entertainment; no candy between 2 and 5 PM)

## Why We Overvalue What We Have

The &#8220;endowment effect&#8221; means that when we own something, we begin to value it more than other people do.

There are three fundamental quirks of human nature:

  * We fall in love with what we already have.
  * We focus on what we might lose, rather than what we might gain.
      * When thinking about selling something, you think about all the things you&#8217;ll miss, rather than the hassles of ownership.
  * We assume that other people will see the transaction from the same perspective as we do.

Peculiarities of ownership:

  * The more work you put into something, the more ownership you begin to feel for it (The &#8220;IKEA effect&#8221;)
  * We can begin to feel ownership even before we own something (The &#8220;eBay effect&#8221;).
      * This is why trials and money-back guarantees work so well! People hate to downgrade.
  * These ownership quirks apply to ideas as well as things&#8230;which is why we end up with ideologies that no longer seem rational.

To counteract the endowment effect, try to view all transactions as a non-owner. This explains the efficacy of the question: &#8220;Assuming you hadn&#8217;t done X, would you still do it now?&#8221;

## Why Options Distract Us from Our Main Objective

We feel compelled to preserve options, even at great expense, even when it doesn&#8217;t make sense.

*&#8220;What we need to do is to consciously start closing some of our doors&#8230;.We ought to shut them because they draw energy and commitment from the doors that should be left open&#8211;and because they drive us crazy.&#8221;*

Even when you get down to two doors, choosing is still difficult.

*&#8220;Choosing between two things that are similarly attractive is one of the most difficult decisions we can make.&#8221;*

When we focus on the similarities and minor differences between two things, we fail to take into account the consequences of not deciding. Flip a coin and move on.

## Why The Mind Gets What It Expects

Previously held expectations can cloud our point of view.

When we believe something will be good, it generally will be good, and when we think it will be bad, it will be bad.  But does finding out the truth _after_ the experience change one&#8217;s mind?

Stereotypes: Not only do we react differently based on stereotypes of others, we react differently based on stereotypes about ourselves.

Shin, Pittinsky, and Ambady conducted an experiment on Asian-American women.

  * A first group was asked questions related to their gender, then given a math test.
  * A second group was asked questions related to their race, then given a math test.
  * The second group did better on the math test than the first.

## The Power of Price

Why a 50-Cent Aspirin Can Do What A Penny Aspirin Can&#8217;t.

The placebo effect is well-known and real.  It&#8217;s not just a matter of fooling oneself; placebos can actually trigger endorphins and opiates and other biological reactions that actually change body and experience. What is interesting, however, is that price has an impact on perceived efficacy. Extremely low-priced (but quality) items will be seen as possibly untrustworthy.

## Given the Opportunity, Many Honest People will Cheat

Experiments were conducted at MIT, Princeton, UCLA, and Yale with similar results, so it&#8217;s not just that Harvard students are crooks.

Once tempted to cheat, students didn&#8217;t seem to be influenced by the risk of getting caught; even when we have no chance of getting caught, we still don&#8217;t become wildly dishonest.

*&#8220;We care about honesty and want to be honest. The problem is that our internal honesty monitor is active only when we contemplate big transgressions, like grabbing an entire box of pens. For little transgressions like taking a single pen, we don&#8217;t even consider how these actions would reflect on our honesty.&#8221;*

Ariely conducted an experiment on MIT&#8217;s communal refrigerators:

  * When he slipped in a 6-pack of Coke, all the Cokes had vanished within 72 hours
  * When he left a plate containing 6 $1 bills, no one \*ever\* took any of the money
  * Would you feel bad about taking a pen for you child?  How about taking $0.10 from petty cash to pay for a pen for your child?  The two are economically identical, but get very different reactions.

*&#8220;Cheating is a lot easier when it&#8217;s a step removed from money.&#8221;*

Overall, cheating is not limited by risk; it is limited by our ability to rationalize the cheating to ourselves.

## Summary

*&#8220;We are all far less rational in our decision making than standard economic theory assumes. Our irrational behaviors are neither random nor senseless&#8211;they are systematic and predictable.  So wouldn&#8217;t economics make a lot more sense if it were based on how people actually behave?  That simple idea is the basis of behavioral economics.&#8221;*
