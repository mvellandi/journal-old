Recently, I watched a fascinating [online documentary from Stanford University](http://datajournalism.stanford.edu/) about data visualization and storytelling. Having been interested in graphic and information design as an occasional hobby for the past 4 years, it&#8217;s interesting to see how the field has rapidly developed with the capability to import datasets from publicly available sources, into programs built from Flash, JavaScript, and HTML.

For these visualizations to be meaningful though, they need to have relatively low cognitive load factors and an interpreter that will tell the story. Overwhelm people and you&#8217;ll give them an ice cream headache, at which point they&#8217;ll tune out and click away. Another potential risk is that by making the design incredibly rich and beautiful, viewers will be distracted and won&#8217;t be able to effectively draw insights.

These fundamental principles will never change, regardless of whether the audience is statisticians or Janitor Jims.
