At first I was a bit wary of watching a low res video at 240p, but [Bill Moggridge of IDEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Moggridge) is worth listening to. That is if you&#8217;re interested in human computer interaction. In this presentation, he reviews examples from his book [Designing Interactions](http://www.designinginteractions.com/), a compilation of 37 interviews with interaction designers that gives a multi-perspective, historical account of HCI along with best practices.

I understand that 84min might be long for you, especially since I didn&#8217;t make any presentation notes this time ðŸ™‚

So please instead, browse around the [Designing Interactions chapters page](http://www.designinginteractions.com/chapters) instead to get a feel of the various topics included, then simply download a PDF chapter you like by modifying in your browser&#8217;s address bar, the number 4 in the following URL:
