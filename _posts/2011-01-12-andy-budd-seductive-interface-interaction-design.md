Andy Budd of [Clear Left](http://clearleft.com/), talks about how to seduce users by creating beautiful interfaces. Sexy!

Although my notes below might be helpful, Andy gives a lot of examples, great visuals, and talks about cognitive psychology and relationships in a fun manner that makes the video really worth watching.

__Presentation Notes__

  * Seduction isn&#8217;t good, bad, or manipulative. It&#8217;s a deep state of affinity and desire evoked from effective persuasion.
  * **Stage #1: The Approach**
      * First impressions matter. The moment we form an opinion, we wrap a halo around it, guarding its integrity because we don&#8217;t like to be proved wrong.
      * Good looks count, as we&#8217;re hard wired to focus on attraction and things that stand out from the crowd. Beauty carries a premium. But radically interesting and different, relative to other choices, carries significant weight as well. A nice design embodies a sense of trust.
      * Be genuine, friendly, and approachable.
      * Gimmicks can be playfully attractive.
      * Be a little mysterious. Don&#8217;t give it all away so fast or easy. Generate interest through curiosity.
  * **Stage #2: Rapport**
      * Shared interests and values build relatedness. Make your web design reflect the attitudes and persona of your intended audience. Use testimonials (social proof) catered to specific website functions/pages. If your website has multiple users, consider how providing info on other similar users or their activities can support relatedness.
      * Being familiar with user&#8217;s interests breeds attractiveness.
      * Establish a relationship through his/her friends. Offer users the ability to send invites, tell-a-friend, share with your network, etc.
      * We like people who like us back.
      * But don&#8217;t be needy.
  * **Stage #3: Desire**
      * Be funny. Laughter, jokes, and being silly is a common way we make connections with other people.
      * Be flirty and playful with your graphics and copywriting.
      * Be cheeky. Make people smile.
      * Use seductive language, not necessarily sexual, but that which teases and hints at visceralness.
      * Give a hint of more to come. But once you&#8217;ve done that, you&#8217;ll want to take it away again. Play hard to get.Â  Desire can be based on loss-aversion in addition to exclusivity and limited-supply.
      * Create sexy interfaces that are luscious and don&#8217;t overwhelm.
      * Consider how image carousels and rollovers can entice.
      * Build a personality into your website and it&#8217;s possible user interactions, including error and alert pages.
  * **Stage #4: Commitment**
      * Proximity is important. The more time you can spend together, the better.
      * Give praise. Could be for task completion, achievements, or other activities.
      * Don&#8217;t be afraid to admit your mistakes though.
      * Be mindful of social exchange theory: that we&#8217;ll maintain a relationship with someone so long as the benefit outweighs the cost.
      * Build attachments, but not exhibiting needy behavior or selfishness.
      * Rubin scale: How much of love/like your partner is in with you. In other words, an affinity scale. Place yourself in others&#8217; shoes, examine feedback, or actively talk to customers to learn how you&#8217;re doing.
      * Other than direct website site interactions, find reasons to (legitimately) get in touch with users through email.
      * Provide rewards to users for their commitment to your site/service.
      * Unlock new abilities (affordances) through continued interaction.
      * Know your users interaction history, and offer relevant tips, similar products, or recommend like-minded users.
      * Provide feedback back to users regarding your relationship together, signifying shared progress.
      * Help users become better, more proficient, reach personal goals, make connections, and continue to be helpful.
