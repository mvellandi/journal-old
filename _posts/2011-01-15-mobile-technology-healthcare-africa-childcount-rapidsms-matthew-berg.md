In late 2009 with gracious support from Microsoft, Matthew Berg and others established the [Rural Technology Lab](http://rtl.mvpafrica.org/) in Mali, Africa, intended to train the first generation of programmers there who started with basic HTML, and ended up learning [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29), [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/), [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29), and [RapidSMS](http://www.rapidsms.org/). They&#8217;ve focused on health services through mobile phones, as more people in Africa have access to mobile phones than access to fever or diarrhea treatment. So Matt along with colleagues at Columbia University created [ChildCount](http://www.childcount.org/), an initiative that works with community health care workers to register children in patient databases, giving them an ID number and the ability to track their health. It has helped with various illnesses like measles, along with communicating with future parents about antenatal health visits. As Matt says, technology is going to drastically change how we change rural health and agriculture, but we should seriously invest in the inputs (training and development) in order to get more outputs. Local input is the solution.
