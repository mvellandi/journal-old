I&#8217;ve met and spoken with Brooke at [Sustainable Brands 10](http://www.sustainablelifemedia.com/events/sb10), where she gave a very similar presentation on her company [RecycleMatch](http://www.recyclematch.com/). I totally LOVE the business idea too: create secondary markets for materials, which might be thought of as scrap or waste. Because there&#8217;s always a demand for materials, since China buys our scrap and sells it back to us as finished goods, the traditional hurdle has been information access to buyers & sellers, quality, and efficient marketplaces where transaction costs and process are simplified. Businesses like [RecycleMatch](http://www.recyclematch.com/) can change that.
