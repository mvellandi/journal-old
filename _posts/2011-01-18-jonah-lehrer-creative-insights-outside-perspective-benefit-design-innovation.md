Great insights on creativity from author Jonah Lehrer. I really dug his story on how one&#8217;s separation from mainstream society and culturally similar people, can be a significant enhancer of innovative spirit, primarily due to the outsider effect of seeing things from a different perspective.

Secondly is the notion that when we place great time and physical distance between us and an idea, the more imaginative and creative effort we&#8217;ll exert when interacting with it. Perhaps there is something more exotic about the distant and historic that makes it more sticky than the near and recent? It&#8217;s more than that.

It&#8217;s the difference between various environments and contexts we&#8217;re currently in. Thinking about &#8220;nature&#8221; while you&#8217;re in New York City will differ from that while in Phoenix. Retreats (and vacations too!) for example are a great time for personal reflection and problem solving precisely because we&#8217;re placed outside of our zone.

Jonah&#8217;s point on multicultural exposure&#8217;s effect on our creativity really made me happy 🙂 since I&#8217;ve lived in Sweden, Germany, and have traveled much in Europe. There&#8217;s a positive outsider effect there too. Lastly, intellectual and practical dissimilarity can be a big positive too in creative problem solving, since one doesn&#8217;t have the curse of pre-existing knowledge and susceptibility to groupthink. A few organizations I know that fully embrace diversity include Cirque de Soleil and Jump Associates.

Outside -> In perspective is the whole basis of ethnographic and design research.
