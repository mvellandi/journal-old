Endearing story from Emily Pilloton of Project H.

> *&#8220;We don&#8217;t work for clients, we work with our partners and with end-users. We do this for a couple reasons&#8230;we don&#8217;t know everything and we need to listen first&#8230;we want to have great feedback loops and relationships with users so we can measure the impact better down the line&#8230;we want everyone to have ownership and a stake in the process.&#8221;*

Gotta love the learning landscapes for making math concrete and interactive, not just a single-player, brute force, cognitive process.
