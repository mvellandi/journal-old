There are moments for every type of communication message including fact reporting, opinion, brief and long explanations, and stories.

The neat thing about stories is that the last page isn&#8217;t necessarily conclusive. It can be any point in time. Continuity is an option. With that, we can reconstruct a very brief story into a longer one that inspires hope and vision.
