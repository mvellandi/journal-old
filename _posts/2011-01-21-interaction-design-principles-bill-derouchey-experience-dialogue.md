Interaction has a language that is&#8230;

  * Created and curated
  * Expressed through visceral stimuli
  * To give priority, clarity, and purpose

__Priority__
Is there a hierarchy or choice architecture? Consider: size, color, placement, display order.

__Clarity__
Does the interface or are the options communicated clearly? Consider: words, icons, color, size, aesthetics

__Purpose__
Is the function of the product/service being maintained throughout the design dialogues (interactions)? Consider: simplicity, perspective, restraint
