> *&#8220;A Visual Life-branded <a href="http://www.intel.com/visuallife">website</a> acts as the hub for user- and Intel-generated content. Consumers are encouraged to share their experiences and upload creations to the site, which will distribute the content simultaneously to Intel&#8217;s Facebook and YouTube pages, and vice versa.*
>
> *The campaign also includes a series of short films that will appear across all Intel digital platforms. The short online films are designed to create conversation and will roll out throughout 2011 across major markets around the world.&#8221;*

The campaign video has a very humanistic, multicultural and generational feel, although one can&#8217;t quite discern what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s not quite a narrative that draws you in, yet the clips are appealing. Is it perhaps that the music is missing a buildup? I would suppose that would help the &#8220;feel good&#8221; nature, while encouraging us to visit the Intel site.

Neat nonetheless, and interesting campaign. With two videos up so far, they&#8217;re wise to include a documentary and a creative advertisement, each as separate but focused experiences. After all, a principle of good content marketing is to provide value AND promote your brand in a contextually relevant way.

I&#8217;m a little concerned if the high creative production so far of the two videos will intimidate some folks to make and contribute their own videos on what a &#8220;visual life&#8221; means to them. What&#8217;s the value for them? Well, it is fair to say that Intel is a large brand and the opportunity to promote oneself across their channels can be a turn on.
