That I did on February 7th, in case you noticed my absence of daily postings ðŸ˜‰

Many more work opportunities here for communications, media, and digital than in my former town of Orange County, CA.

Had planned to move once I had a good amount of savings, a solid plan, and had sold a lot of books among other goals before leaving. Being here now for a week, the weather&#8217;s not bad! Having lived in Northern Sweden for a year at 17, I KNOW what cold can be like. Dressing warm is all one needs to do.

Having a Smartphone with premium applications for Craigslist, the Subway, and free ones like Google Maps, and Yelp are an absolute lifesaver. Checking apartment listings in Brooklyn while my baggage was delayed seemed so radical and fun! By the end of the first evening, I signed a prorated rent check for a shared house. Unfurnished room, but found an unwanted air mattress, table, and chair in the hallway. Easy enough! Chinese neighborhood to the West, Jewish to the East. Plenty of mini food and convenience stores all around me too.

The amount of energy here is intense, but not necessarily overwhelming. Having been practicing active meditation and awareness for a few years now, it&#8217;s fairly easy. There&#8217;s one particular negative observation though in comparison to visiting other cities: a high amount of trash and mini-debris scattered everywhere. Partially I can understand, since streetsweeping trucks aren&#8217;t active during Winter, but it&#8217;s a cultural problem, let&#8217;s face it. Having seen a subway trashcan cover with the big words &#8220;Help keep the Planet Green&#8221; along with small subtitles &#8220;For New York, your community, our city&#8230;&#8221;, as a green marketer I thought to myself: Kill the &#8220;Planet&#8221; notion. Nobody can relate to it because it&#8217;s distant and non-concrete. Instead, create a succinct expression about New York City pride, similar to that of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Mess with Texas&#8221;.

After having situated myself, perfected my [resume](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mvellandi) and [creative portfolio](http://www.behance.net/mvellandi/frame), and attended a few networking events in the first couple days, I&#8217;m now fully on the job application train. First off the list was my favorite PR agency, [Weber Shandwick](http://www.webershandwick.com/), which has strong practices in digital and sustainability & csr (3 divisions in fact!). There are some other known organizations I&#8217;ll apply for open-ended and posted positions.

__*If you can think of ANY brand, NGO, consultancy, or agencies in marketing, design/innovation, business I should add to my list, please leave a comment!*__

I&#8217;ll be posting little updates in the coming weeks again&#8230;Wish me Luck!

And thanks again for being a reader ðŸ™‚
