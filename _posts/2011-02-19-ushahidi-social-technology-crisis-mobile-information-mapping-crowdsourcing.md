I first heard about [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com/) in Clay Shirky&#8217;s book &#8220;[Cognitive Surplus](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KAB2VW?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004KAB2VW)&#8220;, and thought how remarkably cool it was. Erik Hersman is an innovator and technologist advancing the use of technology as an empowerment tool in the developing world, and Co-Founder of Ushahidi (meaning &#8220;witness&#8221; in Swahili), a free, open source, Web / mobile-based platform capable of crowd-sourcing, sharing and mapping crisis information in near real time.

Patrick Meier, director of Crisis Mapping for Ushahidi, shares how the collaborative mapping platform has been used as a tool for citizens and organizations to quickly respond to emergencies. At the PopTech Chicago Salon 2010, Meier describes how Ushahidiâ€™s grassroots response to the Haitian earthquake literally saved lives.
