Great presentation I just watched online as part of a Google mobile internet seminar in New York in February 2011. A couple key things stood out for me in the presentation on WHY this is such an important developing field, along with my own thoughts:

  * We&#8217;ve progressed sequentially from mainframes to mini-computers, terminals, PCs, handheld devices, and now mobile devices. In this time, prices has steadily fallen, computational power has risen, and the relevance and utility for everyday people has risen.
  * Mobile devices with their multiple peripherals, operating system, diverse application library, and net connectivity is and will vastly disrupt the business models of a large number of industries in terms of product viability for customer classes, channels, and communications.
  * Streaming media and cloud-based software & information sharing are going to reduce the need for local data storage in instances where limited utilization and shared information scenarios across multiple devices and people, prevail.
  * Increased voice, audio, and video streaming will further commoditize carriers&#8217; services, whose business models have already been blurring over the last 10 years. The extra data burden from video will likely cause headaches they&#8217;ll have to figure out how to deal with. With the increasing option to connect via WiFi through various services, people will increasingly consider the prices they&#8217;re paying carriers for various media options in comparison to what their actual usage is, and the potential for saving money through 3rd party online players like Netflix, Pandora, and Skype, and integrated services like Apple Facetime.
  * Interactive and relevant advertising on mobile devices will become a lot more prevalent, however the opportunity for people to sign up for premium services from an organization in order to remove ads AND unlock extra features, will drive the building of more hybrid business models.
  * More companies will be developing mobile software products than ever before, along with digital multimedia assets to go along with it. These will serve not only customers and the public, but also employees, partners, and other stakeholders. Wherever efficiency and effectiveness in data access & interaction, integrated across multiple platforms, can be realized to a business advantage, it will be realized.

We have to think of the big picture competitive opportunities in classical terms of process efficiency, lean thinking, logistics, communications, sales, product/service innovation, and financial accounting. It&#8217;s all there.
