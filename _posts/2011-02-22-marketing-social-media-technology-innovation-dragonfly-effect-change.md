I first read about the stories of Sameer and Vinay in Jennifer Aaker and her husband&#8217;s book, &#8220;[The Dragonfly Effect](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470614153?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470614153)&#8220;. It&#8217;s a powerful narrative that goes to show what constraints, a concrete goal, storytelling, marketing, and simple metrics can do. A highly recommended book which I hope to share lessons from in a future post, and which provided lots of insights into how a tightly integrated campaign can effect lots of change in a relatively short period of time.
