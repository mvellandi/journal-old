Seriously, this is an awesome design concept. While digital recordings are simply the future, forever, there is something pleasant about holding a physical representation of an artist, album, or mixtape (playlist). IDEO designers created a concept stereo system with an electronic device underneath a box, holding the various songs. Underneath the topside of the box are radio-frequency sensors that when activated, will tell the device what song or album to play. Paper cards with artist information printed on them, contain an RFID tag with an identifier for a particular playlist. As you can see in the video above, the cards&#8217; contact with the box&#8217;s surface activates the new playlist.

Simply cool.
