The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy approached IDEO with a daunting challenge: reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies in the U.S. for women between the ages of 18 and 29. In other words: try and alter one of natureâ€™s most powerful urges. Given the tension between todayâ€™s media-driven culture, religious mores, and biological imperatives, the project called for delicate and persuasive storytelling. The lesson: translating stories into high-impact messagesâ€”with the weight required to modify behaviorâ€”requires precisely the right tone.

Very inspiring indeed, and the type of long term digital marketing campaigns that I&#8217;d love to produce. Come on big aspirational PR agency, hire me and let&#8217;s do this! ðŸ™‚
