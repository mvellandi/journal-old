We have passed the era of Peak MHz. The race in CPU development is now for smaller, cheaper, and less power-hungry processors. As the price of powerful CPUs approaches that of basic components, how information processing is used—and how to design with/for it—fundamentally changes. When information processing is this cheap, it becomes a material with which to design the world, like plastic, iron, and wood. This vision argues that most information processing in the near future will not be in some distant data center, but immediately present in our environment, distributed throughout the world, and embedded in things we don&#8217;t think of as computers (or even as &#8220;phones&#8221;).

Mike Kuniavsky of [Orange Cone](http://www.orangecone.com/), discusses what it means to treat information as a material, the properties of information as a design material, the possibilities created as such, and design approaches. Information as a material enables The Internet of Things, object-oriented hardware, smart materials, ubiquitous computing, and intelligent environments.
