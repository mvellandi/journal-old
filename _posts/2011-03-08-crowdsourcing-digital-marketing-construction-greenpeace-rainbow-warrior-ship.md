Amazing digital marketing campaign for Greenpeace that represents the best of both creative advertising, public relations, and co-creation. This represents the kind of work companies and organizations involved in sustainability and cause marketing should be asking their agencies to do. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to do! Get people to feel like they&#8217;re part of something greater. Rally them into your cause. Get them to act beyond merely sending a promotional tweet or pushing a Facebook &#8220;Like&#8221; button.
