Great learning reference for user experience design, primarily for online interaction, but applicable to other disciplines too. As Peter Morville who drew the map below says in his article,

> *&#8220;This list describes twenty user experience deliverables with links to relevant resources and examples. Clearly, these artifacts of the process are not the whole story. We must also think about the relationship between goals, methods, and documents. And yet, for many of us, deliverables are the coin of the realm and merit special attention.&#8221;*
