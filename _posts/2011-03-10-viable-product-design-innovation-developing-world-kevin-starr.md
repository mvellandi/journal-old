Wow! This is a great talk on product/service design for the developing world. As with any product development process (waterfall or agile), the outcome must be useful and viable. Here&#8217;s the official video description:

Kevin Starr, [Mulago Foundation](http://www.mulagofoundation.org/) director, looks for the best solutions to the biggest problems in the poorest countries. He thinks all projects need to answer four questions:

  1. **Is it needed?**
  2. **Does it work?**
  3. **Will it get to those who need it?**
  4. **Will they use it correctly when they get it?**

Too many bad ideas are using up our limited resources and that needs to change.
