I must say, the research and trend folks over at PSFK have done an excellent job in this report for the United Nations. Considering the client, it should be good, and not some futuristic techno/retro idealism based on fads and long term predictions. You may sense my disdain for futurism, although many of my blog posts may point otherwise, I aim to live in the present while objectively understanding the possibilities for a positive future.
