Been thinking about open innovation lately.

Not necessarily about tech platforms, rights management, and so on.

But rather on the participant&#8217;s experience.

  * Is there a challenge submitted by a sponsoring organization?
  * Or does the effort provide a collective benefit to participants?
  * How long does it take new users to orient themselves with the environment/interface and get to participate?
  * Are idea submissions completely crafted by the individual, then submitted for review?
  * Or are they draft-submitted to a group, built upon, and submitted as a concept for further review?
  * What are the phases? (Ex: ideation, filtering, fit analysis, iterative review)
  * Online: If only one project is open at a time, which global navigation options are essential to have in the active experience state?
  * To what degree is the general public invited to participate?
  * If large, what is their incentive(s) to participate?
  * Who are the participating stakeholders?
  * What&#8217;s the ratio of participating internal to external stakeholders?
  * Is there a pre-defined total project time?
  * Or do phases&#8217; term lengths vary with activity rates and phase fulfillment needs?
  * Is the process fully online, offline, or a hybrid mix of both?

I think that if we consider open innovation as a valuable way to develop great ideas, then we have to highly take personal and social psychology, economics, and human-computer interaction design factors into the architecture and operation of such a system. Although such platforms are relatively new (technologically speaking), we can&#8217;t just license a white-label software platform and tweak it to our liking.

Whatever the goal of the site is, be it voting or sharing ideas, long or short-term engagement, there&#8217;s two basic principles I always espouse in interaction design (coming from my sales experience):

  1. **Address &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for ME?&#8221; (participant as beneficiary)**
  2. **Get participants into and out of your interaction process as quickly as possible. Respect their time!**

I like to think of these points as absolutely essential for motivating people&#8217;s logic and emotion to participate. Each open innovation platform will need to address its operational rules differently based on the context, but neglecting these two points **will** hinder: adoption, repeated use, happiness, and word of mouth.
