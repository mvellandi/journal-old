As a marketing gent wearing hats for content development, community engagement, public relations, and sometimes for graphic design, there&#8217;s always a need to be self-critical. Because no matter what, the customer&#8217;s happiness counts. In terms of how your product, service, and relationship benefits them. But let&#8217;s face it: Value comes down to a variety of different aspects. A slightly unsatisfactory ongoing experience somewhere along the along the line may cause them to switch to someone else in the long run.

Peter Morville of [Semantic Studios](http://semanticstudios.com/) put together this concept of the [UX Honeycomb](http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php) back in 2004, which I believe represents a solid 6 aspects of the user experience that marketers, developers, and designers must try to maximize to the best of their ability. The terms are pretty self explanatory on their own, but if you&#8217;d like an interaction designer&#8217;s point of view, Peter explains them in the previous link. I&#8217;ve remixed his diagram to my own fancy. Enjoy!
