For a deeper read into the topic, please read the [Wikipedia article on &#8220;electioneering communication&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission). The nonprofit public advocacy and rights organization [Public Citizen](http://www.citizen.org/), worked with Annie Leonard and [Free Range Studios](http://www.freerange.com/) to produce the following animated video as part of a campaign, [Democracy is for People](http://democracyisforpeople.org/). Amusing and compelling to say the least. I love the giant robot caricature akin to Godzilla.
