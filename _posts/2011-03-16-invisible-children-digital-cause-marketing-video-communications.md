Another great nonprofit I learned about last year with superb digital marketing is [Invisible Children](http://www.invisiblechildren.com/). Particularly, [their use of video is inspirational](http://vimeo.com/invisible) and provides viewers with concrete evidence and feedback. The more time invested in high quality video production and editing, the better you get at it. Their website info, graphic, and content design is great too. It&#8217;s because of organizations like these that I&#8217;m inspired to bring high quality creative, engaging content, and focused interaction design to future communication projects in sustainability.

Here&#8217;s the first of a new campaign video, [followed by the second accompanied by animated info design](http://vimeo.com/20387605) to demonstrate the proposed action plan as part of the fundraising for April 25th.
