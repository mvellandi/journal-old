I had heard about the [Toyota Ideas for Good](http://www.toyota.com/ideas-for-good/) campaign only recently, and after some exploration of the site, found it a great example of crowdsourcing ideas and public engagement. Also, it positions the brand for being innovative, in addition to whatever key ideas emerge as the winners. I have a feeling that &#8220;safety&#8221; for strategic branding reasons, will be a theme 🙂 Check out the video below for the overview. Also, I had noticed they had a [dedicated YouTube playlist of 12 Ideas for Good Technologies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ujg9QXg4gVo&feature=list_related&playnext=1&list=SPFBC7DF754281342C). Great work guys (and agency partners!). Me likes your videos.
