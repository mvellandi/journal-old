Neat content marketing campaign around the upcoming release of the BMWi and ActiveE cars, by filming a four-part video series around the future of mobility, through interviews on the website.

In their own words,

> *&#8220;<a href="http://bmwactivatethefuture.com/">BMWActivatetheFuture.com</a> was created to get users actively involved in the ever-evolving conversation on the future of mobility. Over the coming months, this site will continue to explore new ways to shape the future of mobility and will encourage usersâ€™ opinions and participation along the way.&#8221;*

Note however that the only mention of the upcoming cars are through the about page, and a brief aside at the end of the last video. BMW knows the value of great content after the wild success of their short films with Clive Owen in the early 2000s.
