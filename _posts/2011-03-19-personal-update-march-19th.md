Since moving to New York, I&#8217;ve held a daily routine of searching, indexing, and applying for jobs, regular exercise (jog/walk 4 miles, yoga), networking, and reconnecting with people. Some days I&#8217;d skip one thing or another, but tried to hold this schedule fairly consistently. It worked well.

Until I received interest from a new acquaintance I reached out to, who wanted to fill a client service manager position right away. At that point two weeks ago, I stopped searching and applying. The company was [Addison](http://www.addison.com), a respectable communications firm specializing in annual reports, branding, and information design. Boy was I excited! This was an opportunity to help Fortune 100 clients develop sustainability reports in print and online, along with a small opportunity to provide social media advising too. My interview was earlier this week.

I didn&#8217;t get the position, having been told during the interview that I probably wouldn&#8217;t be a good fit for their culture. What was wrong? What did I say? Well, I did appreciate the candid feedback. Although we may really want a job, we have to acknowledge that sometimes a position just wouldn&#8217;t be right for us in the long run. During our talk, I disclosed a passion for personal productivity and execution. Seems okay right? For this particular position, the nature of the work needed pure project management and lots of client service in a daily environment with many meetings and low-productivity. My entrepreneurial background, low tolerance for inaction, and creative edge were just not going to fit with the needs of the position.

At first I was upset. This seemed like a really cool company with lots of potential to do meaningful work in sustainability communications! But I was thankful for the immediate feedback. What did this mean though? After some reflection, I realized that aspects of our personality, habits, and work history will fundamentally affect not only our fit for a type of job, but also our long term happiness in that role, regardless of the organization we&#8217;re working for. I realized at that point, that being an account executive or coordinator in an agency is just not for me, and I might as well not apply to any of these types of positions. Community management, creative marketing, and media production are my strengths. Let&#8217;s stick with those.

So earlier this week I also received a second call for an interview. The [Rubin Museum](http://rmanyc.org/) was looking for a Web Content Coordinator, who&#8217;d develop and manage digital content, and work with their social media accounts. Woo Hoo! Right up my alley. I came prepared on Thursday, having read a fortuitously timed [8-part article series in the NY Times on digital media and museums](http://www.experientia.com/blog/social-media-internet-technology-and-museums/), published the previous day. I met with 5 people at once, who were all very friendly. I think I spoke a little too much in the beginning though, regarding why my work history prepared me to be an excellent candidate. In retrospect, it would have been great to personally address two gentlemen how I&#8217;d help their particular goals in education and production. But alas, time was limited as they had to go after a while. The rest of the interview went fairly well, I believe, having asked some questions of my own, and I should hear back from them early next week. The opportunity to help promote Himalayan art and culture would be amazing!

Having had two interviews now, I know that I&#8217;ll get better with time. It&#8217;s just that when we really like a job, it seems there&#8217;s a demotivation to apply to others. I told myself when I moved here that focusing on **&#8220;Process&#8221;** is much more important than **&#8220;Outcomes&#8221;**. I realize that fretting over what I should/could have said, and being anxious about early next week, does the spirit no good. All we can do is move forward, living in daytime compartments, realizing the past is behind us, and recognizing aspects of the interview process we can improve upon.

But thinking is not enough. We have to literally write these principles down. In our own words. And post them up on the wall to remind ourselves. This is what I did.

Momentum is important. Talking about our goals and feelings with others is important too, hence the secondary reason for writing this personal blog post today. We&#8217;re all just human. But we have the power to adapt to change, learn from our past, and get better.

It&#8217;s about having a vision. Maintaining hope. Applying discipline. Persevering.

Smiling in the face of it all.
