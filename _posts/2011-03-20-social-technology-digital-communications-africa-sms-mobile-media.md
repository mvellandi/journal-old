Erik Hersman, who [I&#8217;ve profiled here before with videos about Ushahidi](../ushahidi-social-technology-crisis-mobile-information-mapping-crowdsourcing/), gives a big perspective of social technology development across Africa using SMS, mapping, media, and payments. Great work and inspirational. Did you know that last year, Facebook worked with multiple mobile carriers in the continent to allow free data access to its social network? Crazy and cool.
