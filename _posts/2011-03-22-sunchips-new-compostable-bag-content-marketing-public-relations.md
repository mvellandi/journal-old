Yay! [SunChips](http://www.sunchips.com/) fixed the loud bag problem ðŸ™‚ In case you didn&#8217;t know, the original SunChips biodegradable bag introduced last year was pulled off the shelf for all flavors except original, after 10 months due to bag crinkling noise level complaints and reduced sales. Interestingly, they&#8217;ve fixed the problem and Brad Rogers is here to talk about it in an amusing way.

This is great public relations. Use demonstrations and real people to talk about new product development, corporate responsibility, you name it. The video reminds me of the lab scene from [BlendTec&#8217;s &#8220;Will it Blend?&#8221; series](http://www.willitblend.com/).

Bring viewers behind the scenes, give them an inside look. Explain what&#8217;s going on. Be objective, have a sense of humor, and don&#8217;t take too long telling the story. Just don&#8217;t employ an ad agency to do the work for you, unless they have content development experience.
