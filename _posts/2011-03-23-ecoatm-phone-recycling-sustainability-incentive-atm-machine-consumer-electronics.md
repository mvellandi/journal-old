A viable business solution that addresses an important environmental and social need: cell phone and gadget recycling. The secondary market has always been huge, but let&#8217;s face it. Knowing how and where to recycle an portable electronic device is very difficult. Few people are inclined to go through the process of selling theirs on eBay. An easy, accessible process that provides instant gratification with a fair value exchange, should be a winner.

[ecoATM](http://www.ecoatm.com/) out of Southern California has addressed this need. As the video shows, the process is pretty advanced and straightforward. Probably a good reason why [Coinstar](http://www.coinstar.com/) (also the owners of movie rental kiosk [RedBox](http://www.redbox.com/)), [have invested in the company.](http://www.bnet.com/blog/clean-energy/4-reasons-coinstar-8217s-bet-on-ecoatm-will-be-as-fruitful-as-its-redbox-venture/2293)
