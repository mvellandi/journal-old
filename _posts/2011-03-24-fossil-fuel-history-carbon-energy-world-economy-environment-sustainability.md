I&#8217;ve never liked gloom. But whether exaggerated or not, representative of reality (past, present, future), it provides the reason for change and progress. Situational enlightenment is just the starting point. Leadership, planning, and collective action takes us forward.

So here&#8217;s a neat animated video from the [Post Carbon Institute](http://www.postcarbon.org/) on the history of fossil fuels, civilization, and world economics over the last 300 years. Amusing, sad, and hopeful. My favorite part was the gent saying sorry, preparing to drop a bow-tied present into the ground at 4:05
