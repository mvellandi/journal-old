Just came across a great article on cognitive psychology and interaction design you might enjoy: [How Your Coffee Mug Controls Your Feelings (& What You Can Do About It)](http://johnnyholland.org/2011/03/01/how-your-coffee-mug-controls-your-feelings-what-you-can-do-about-it/)

The concept that our entire interaction ecosystem including physical, social, and language elements affects our thoughts and behavioral patterns comes as no surprise to those of us who understand the influence that design disciplines, social skills, and [transformational grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_grammar) has on our psyche. Add to that various principles of behavioral economics that are rooted within the human race, and we realize how (non) independent we are, despite our best intentions and desire 🙂

What this means in the larger sense is that if we do want to influence our own or other people&#8217;s thoughts and behaviors, we have to start by:

  1. **Developing skills in metacognition, empathy, psychology, and awareness.**
  2. **Understanding the cognitive impact of various practices in graphic, environmental, physical, and interaction design disciplines.**
  3. **Applying principles of NLP (neuro linguistic programming) to increasingly steer attitudes, feelings, and reactions toward intended outcomes.**

There are many other steps and actions required for behavioral change depending on the context, but I believe that without these 3 fundamental internal skills, our ability to affect change will be limited.

Since innovation agencies rely on these skills in observation, multi-disciplinary design, and interpersonal communication in product/service systems, they should help you too.
