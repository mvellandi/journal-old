[<img src="/images/2011/george-patton-general-military-204x300.jpg" />](../2011/george-patton-general-military.jpg)Not knowing much about U.S. General George Patton, except being a controversial figure, I decided to watch [the 1970 film about his service in World War II](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066206/), played by George C. Scott. Afterwards, I read the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Patton) which gave further details about his character and additional experiences during the war. An inspirational figure to say the least!

Based on my passion for sustainability, objectivity, and a &#8220;middle path&#8221; in enterprise growth & effectiveness, allow me to relish in some greater perspective.

Much has been said about the cut-throat, militaristic style of business management that takes no prisoners and pursues supremacy. Having gained admiration during the 1980s and 90s when raiding and hostile takeovers were in vogue, and emblematic industry titans such as Jack Welch and Lee Iacoca were admired for their pure objectivity on financial health, this mindset began losing its luster after the turn of the century. Pursuing maximum operational efficiency and treating employees and partners as expendable assets had their costs, and it increasingly began to show in an interdependent, global economy where product/service commoditization and fickle customer loyalty became the norm.

Although I&#8217;m an ardent supporter of the compassionate style of management that encourages distributed leadership, kaizen, employee development, innovation, and a long term orientation, there are some distinct elements of the &#8220;tough guy&#8221; approach that are so appealing. Here are my thoughts followingÂ  some reflection after the movie and article.

## Fight Mediocrity

Is the concept of War applied to business inhumane to you? It shouldn&#8217;t. Throw out any pre-existing conceptions you may have, and think about this: The marketplace for products, services, and talent has been commoditized in terms of functions and price, and it&#8217;s resulted in a lot of mediocrity. Both great talent and managers are hard to find and keep. Culture matters. While there are rules and ethics to be followed, every organizational department can pursue greatness and strive to be competitively better. It&#8217;s a team effort. If you can&#8217;t deliver an exceptional product and customer experience, analyze where the shortcomings are by studying the industry, yourself, and seek to value innovate to change the business model. If there&#8217;s evidence that one can&#8217;t significantly improve, cut your losses, and reinvest in another product or process that&#8217;ll yield greater performance. Easier said than done, but trust your intuition and fight with grit. The cost of morale and money matters.

## Apply Discipline

We&#8217;ve probably all experienced how lax environments can be comforting, but likely decrease human productivity, motivation, and total operational performance. Overly disciplined environments can feel degrading on the spirit, weakening morale and encouraging an &#8220;us v. them&#8221; mentality. Yet fair rules, communicated well, reduce mistakes and help everyone get their job done more effectively. You can probably think of a variety of operational and tactical rules that are relevant for a business process or industry. Discussing those will be too subjective. But I will advise you to examine all the microbehaviors that in the long-run increase process and turnaround time. Which activities are providing little value, while taking people away from the front lines? Question everything. Many organizations&#8217; troops are working in a metaphorical swamp because of the horrible effect of multitasking and distractions (social, technological). Increase personal productivity to increase happiness, and the positive business effects will follow. Lastly, consider various approaches to dealing with insubordination. Both system conditions, capabilities, and diverse psychological (personal, social) reasons can be at play. Observe, gather feedback, and act accordingly. But remember that sometimes rules can be bent **IF** they provide benefit to the customer experience, increase operational performance, yield principled cost savings, and **DON&#8217;T** negatively impact other system processes.

## Admit Weaknesses

On an humanistic level that is. Both leaders and individuals need to recognize excessive pride, shortcomings in interpersonal communication, being too pragmatic, whatever it is. Patton recognized and admitted to being a prima donna, for which he accepted having to be reassigned or laying low while others played on. He loved the game, sought victory and glory, but recognized the importance of the entire allied team&#8217;s performance and acted respectfully when told to hold back. Emotional intelligence? You betcha.
