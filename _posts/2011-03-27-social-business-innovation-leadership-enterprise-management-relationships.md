I love the idea. Increased interpersonal communication, transparency, using kindness and objectivity to differentiate and be more responsive to stakeholder needs&#8230;it all links up part of Peter Senge&#8217;s vision for the learning organization. Here&#8217;s the official video description:

> *&#8220;A more open and transparent world challenge us to rethink the way we do business, the way we organize and the way we lead. Globalization, Tranparency, Social Media, Collaborative software &#8211; all part of a social revolution that forces companies to engage in Social Business Innovation and Open Business Leadership. What can we learn from LEGO, Google, Starbucks, Proctor & Gamble and Nike?&#8221;*
