Okay, right off the bat: this is high-level theory. But it&#8217;s very well explained, practical, and wrapped in stories & dialogue at a smooth, continuous pace. While there&#8217;s [lots of gems throughout the article and the 4 videos](http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/user_experience_and_experience_design.html) (which I watched first), I was particularly struck about how Marc described experiences as actual and reflective. The first is the objective, in-the-moment phenomena dealing with functionality, usability, and visceral stimulation. The latter is the subjective, retained memory of the emotions activated, benefits felt, and stories we remember and use to tell others. Marc describes the latter as the most important aspect of the experience because it&#8217;s so personal.

In-depth commentaries and thoughts from Don Norman and Whitney Hess are included in the article too, so I recommend go checking them out.

Here&#8217;s the first video in the series:
