Richard Buchanan is Professor of Design, Management, and Information Systems at the Weatherhead School of Management, [Case Western Reserve University](http://www.case.edu/). He is well known for extending the application of design into new areas of theory and practice, writing and teaching as well as practicing with the concepts and methods of Interaction Design. He argues that interaction design does not stop at the flatland of the computer screen but extends into the personal and social life of human beings. At the Weatherhead, he has turned his work toward &#8220;collective interactions,&#8221; focusing on problems of organizational change and a reform of management education around the concept of &#8220;managing by design.&#8221;

If you can&#8217;t watch the whole video, here are my notes below:

### Who Are We?

Design has no subject matter

20th century goals: mass production & mass communication

These were fulfilled by industrial and graphic design

Interaction design developed as a means to address &#8220;**action**&#8221;

First concepted during the Bauhaus movement from [John Dewey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey), with &#8220;**experience**&#8221; core aspect of one&#8217;s relationship to artifacts and communication.

Aspects of Experience: Inception, Development, Fulfillment

With the advent of computers, interfaces, control surfaces and the like, the interaction design discipline took its early form.

Buchanan&#8217;s definition of interaction: **_&#8220;How people relate to other people through the mediating influence of products.&#8221;_**

Product as anything made by human beings

### Where Are We?

**_&#8220;Designers of the actions, processes, and experiences of people.&#8221;_**

_**&#8220;We act as we form intentions, wishes, plans, goals.&#8221;**_

Richard&#8217;s &#8220;Triangle of Doom&#8221; &#8211; 3 aspects to be balanced to be a product: logos, ethos, and pathos.

In [Liz Sanders](http://www.maketools.com/about.html) words:

  1. __Useful__ - intellectual/functional benefit shaped by content specialists
  2. __Usable__ - difficulty/diversity of use aided through sociology/psychology
  3. __Desirability__ - identity, ethos aided by the art community

If analyzing interaction:

  1. What is interacting? Entities
  2. How does an interaction take place? Through an interface
  3. To what end or purpose?

There won&#8217;t be one answer

In the big picture, the transactions are between people

Inanimate entities are just intermediaries

[Erving Goffman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman) &#8211; The form of an interaction is: inauguration, maintenance, and leave-taking

Richard states the fourth type of interaction as: environments, systems, and organizations

How do you design for participation?

So that people feel part of a bigger whole

It&#8217;s related to Philip Kotler&#8217;s 4th kind of relationship customers can have with organizations, where the customer is &#8220;part&#8221; of the brand, in a non-dualistic sense. No outsider, no insider.

Puzzling and very difficult to achieve.

Interaction Design Spectrum:

&#8211; person to thing

&#8211; person to person

&#8211; person to environment

&#8211; participatory design

### Where Are We Going?

In the future, there will be more people from various disciplines and fields entering the interaction design space and process. It will be more diverse. Products may be more distressing and complex.

In my opinion however, they could also become better for their unique application and context ðŸ™‚
