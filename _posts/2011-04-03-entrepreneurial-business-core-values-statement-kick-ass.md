As much as I&#8217;d like to take credit for writing this, I can&#8217;t. That goes to someone at [Quirky](http://www.quirky.com/), a fun startup I recently visited in NYC that hosted a party. So is this then a Creative-Commons Attribution work? Well damn, I just snapped a photo of the poster and changed a few words around when the company name was mentioned, so that it could be universally applicable to any team. My buddy wanted an 18&#8243; x 24&#8243; poster of it, so I made it this afternoon. Shoot me an email, and I&#8217;ll send you a PDF.
