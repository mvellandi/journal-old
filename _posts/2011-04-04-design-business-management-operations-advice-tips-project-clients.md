Excellent presentation on what to avoid in business operations for practically any type of consultancy. I&#8217;ve made some errors in my time, but wasn&#8217;t always burned on them. But could have been. David points out the mistakes and what to do instead, maintaining an objective and fair working relationship with clients. Enjoy!
