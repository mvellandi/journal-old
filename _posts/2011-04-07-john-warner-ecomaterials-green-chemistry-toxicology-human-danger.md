Having heard from an author about how chemistry students have never had to take a single course in toxicology, it just made sense why so many fantastic products, solvents, adhesives, and more can be toxic. The whole mindset of build it first, then mitigating any known human dangers or environmental costs by building it into scope 1 operational costs (never minding life cycle impacts), is just so warped.

John Warner of the [WarnerBabcock Institute for Green Chemistry](http://www.warnerbabcock.com/about_wbi/john_warner.asp), explains the state of affairs and how it all came to be.
