Ready for some more cognitive psychology? While you&#8217;ve probably heard from me or others how too many choices confuse or slow us down, Barry Schwartz who wrote [&#8220;The Paradox of Choice&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060005696/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060005696), has some more insights to share in an amusing way.

What makes us happy? Societies flourish and people are most content when they are faced with fewer choices and more constraints. We are tortured by the idea of having it all.

In my opinion, people deserve guidance. Constraints also force rational real-world thinking upon us, while also inspiring creativity to think inside the box.
