<img src="/images/2011/bastian-unterberg-jovoto.jpg" />Early last month, I met up with Bastian following an online invitation I took him up on. Knowing he was German and being a digital entrepreneur, I just couldn&#8217;t help myself from the opportunity to chat a bit in my second tongue and about the prospects for the future of digital media and creative production.

About 4 years ago, Bastian left his work doing programming and decided to venture out with a purpose: Connect creatives and clients together through a community platform that produces the best deliverables, faster, and without an agency. [Jovoto](http://www.jovoto.com/) was born.

Exciting! Two value innovation forces were in action: Crowdsourcing and Disintermediation. After all, creative agencies can promise the world to their clients seeking production work, but having the best available talent for the client is really a marketplace challenge. Either they can source that talent at the right price and time availability, or not. As brokers, there&#8217;s also an information acquisition, comprehension, translation, and transmission time and competence involved, for which they may not be best qualified or be able to turn around fast. That&#8217;s just for talent agencies.

For the branding/design agencies, it&#8217;s an even more complicated affair because they&#8217;re trying to build a long-term relationship with clients to sell them on additional work, and then uses these relationships and associated portfolio pieces as agency identity material. But in the end, they&#8217;re just adding more costs and turnaround time to clients **who already know** what they want, and **don&#8217;t** need help with positioning, messaging, and other complementary services.

So the neat thing about Jovoto is the 3-tiered membership model. In the first, creatives can contribute parts of a project challenge, and the participants then decide how much each person should be monetarily compensated. With participation and approved work, creatives earn karma points which signify talent, reliability, and so on. The second and third membership tiers are for members with higher karma points, and for which greater monetary compensation along with tighter project coordination and clients relationships are possible.

There are certain types of defined work that whether low- or high-skilled, can be readily sourced through brokers. This is a commodity market.

Creatives don&#8217;t deserve that kind of treatment. Efficient marketplaces can match brands&#8217; unique needs with the best talent available through crowdsourcing or individual selection. Jovoto aims to do just that, being the most transparent, least-intrusive, intelligent hub, while improving the experience for everyone involved. Rock on!
