After seeing a few of his documentaries and being amused with his curious attitude toward investigating any subject, I was asking myself: What was Morgan up to this time? Being a marketer made me curious. Watch the TED talk he delivered to find out:

Looking at the brand names that agreed to sponsor the movie without knowing much about the script, I wasn&#8217;t surprised. Except perhaps with the Hyatt hotel. But considering their competition, conservative Marriott and snobby Hilton, they could use some unique promotional exposure through affiliation and placement.

[The Greatest Movie Ever Sold](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1743720/) airs in theaters this month.
