Recently, I applied for a social content marketing position with [FreshDirect](http://www.freshdirect.com/), a popular New York City online grocer. The individual would be assigned to work with both the merchandising team and social media manager to develop stories around the products and perhaps how customers were using them.

Now, my first instinct (and perhaps yours too), would be to take lots of photos and videos of stocked merchandise, create little stories around them, and post them on the brand&#8217;s blog, Facebook, Twitter, and a few dedicated multimedia channels like Flickr and Vimeo. That&#8217;s an undertaking in itself, but not hard. One could do this indefinitely and make a full-time job out of it, considering the amount of merchandise a grocer carries, along with the types of stories covered, like item or supplier backstories, recipes or applications (as recommended by suppliers, the retailer, or customers). Alternatively, one could create little stories about the retailers operations including staff, biodiesel trucks, sourcing and freshness, bakeries and chefs, and so on.

Off the bat, all of these tactics are great. However, any marketer worth his grain is going to look at the big picture, and not just the limited scope of existing paradigms for social media and content marketing.

If we [examine their website](http://www.freshdirect.com/category.jsp?catId=hmr_entree_pltry&trk=dnav) alone, it&#8217;s using a centered, fixed-width layout of approximately 750px wide. This may work universally to accommodate users with 4&#215;3 aspect ratio screens, set at a 1024&#215;768 resolution. Yet for people with wide screens and higher resolutions, the experience is cluttered. Instead, FreshDirect should redesign its layouts to percentage-based widths. For an example, [see this Amazon books page](http://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=sa_menu_bo8?ie=UTF8&node=283155). In so doing, they&#8217;ll increase white space for text blocks and photos, while allowing greater recognition and focus on individual elements. This is an essential aspect to effective merchandising and displays, whether in-store or online.

Now let&#8217;s consider email marketing. Weekly circulars are standard procedure in offline, and should be online too. I used to receive the best emails from Borders bookstore, which included beautifully designed graphics showcasing new merchandise and sales going on, in addition to a limited-time coupon for 15% off anything in store. For online marketing, newsletters can come in a variety of formats and could be dynamically generated based on user-defined preferences (what they willingly subscribe to), related items to their purchase history, and according to the time of year and upcoming holidays. In my opinion, all new customers should automatically be enrolled for general newsletters, or be provided the option of subscribing to custom ones in new user registration forms.

On becoming a new user with FreshDirect, I didn&#8217;t notice ANY newsletter subscription options. Maybe I was auto-enrolled. The welcome email was concise, but honestly a bit bland and non-enticing since it had no photos. The cute little food icons should at least be clickable to that relevant category on the website ðŸ™‚

So I&#8217;ll just have to see if I&#8217;ll get any future email updates from them with a visceral or logical reason to shop sometime soon. The opportunity is there, and I&#8217;ve seen plenty of other online retailers screw up on email marketing by either being boring (&#8220;_yet another email to scan and delete in this crowded inbox_&#8220;), or irrelevant (&#8220;_I don&#8217;t like this type of merchandise, why are they sending me info on this?_&#8220;). As previously mentioned, a good opportunity would be to add value to people&#8217;s lives through recipes and tips on picking, pairing, preparing, cooking, serving, along with nutritional advice.

Another opportunity for comparative merchandising and content marketing is by looking at [Whole Foods](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/products/) and [Trader Joe&#8217;s](http://www.traderjoes.com/recipes/index.asp). Seriously, visit these two links now and you&#8217;ll see the power of great photography, graphic design, and media production.

So is this content &#8220;social&#8221;? Well, it can distributed through social media channels. However that would just be scratching the surface. There&#8217;s a couple quick ideas we could toss around:

  1. Solicit recipe and cooking ideas from all customers, and have them post them on Facebook including a photo or two. Select a couple, then include them in your newsletters, website, and social media channels. Weekly or special contests are also great ideas.
  2. Get a lunch truck for driving around the city, and stock it with specially priced ready-made FreshDirect meals for sale, in addition to sample giveaways of fresh herbs, vegetables, and other merchandise with a little hangtag about the item&#8217;s backstory, health value, and where to find it on the website. Use Twitter to update the truck&#8217;s location throughout the city.

Whatever it is, involve the public and your customers in your marketing communications. Make sampling and new trials easy. Highlight happy and innovative customers. Make it about the &#8220;community&#8221; and how you&#8217;re striving to enhance people&#8217;s lives through delicious, flavorful, healthy, and natural food.
