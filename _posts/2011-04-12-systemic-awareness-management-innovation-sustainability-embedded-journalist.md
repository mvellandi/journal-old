A couple weeks ago, I attended an event on sustainable business and management hosted by [Vault.com](http://Vault.com). Many great topics were discussed, among them the importance of executive leadership to inspire employees on the firm&#8217;s values to society and how everyone can contribute to the underlying purpose. With [Jeffrey Hollender](http://www.jeffreyhollender.com/) there, I was thinking of asking if it would be okay if we just cloned him, or if GMO Jeffries would be unethical ðŸ˜›

Since the subject of systems thinking and change was brought up a couple times, I pondered how change is even possible to begin with. There has to be a stimulus, an identified deficiency, problem, threat, opportunity, and so forth. A system must be consistently aware of its environmental & self conditional state. Only then, according to the existential purpose within a system&#8217;s DNA and conditional logic, can it adequately respond by growing/contracting, advancing/retreating, and shifting resources to adequately respond to these changing conditions.

For enterprise management, this completely makes sense as various monitoring & assessment software and analytical methodologies are used to properly respond to changing circumstances. Secondly, a healthy organization is one where employees are encouraged and empowered to recognize problems, and actively fix them or quickly report them for further analysis and action. Yet for the holistic practice of sustainable management, few areas are measured and acted upon. Or perhaps there&#8217;s multiple ways to look at the same picture (ex: comparing scenarios based on price, quality, and time). While I know it&#8217;s quite a diverse field that spans many enterprise functions, total resource efficiency and employee happiness are just two areas that can be examined for weaknesses and improvements.

In order for leaders to rally the troops around a specific objective related to its values and mission, or for empowered employees to act on their own, there needs to be people that can investigate the nooks and crannies to identify what&#8217;s going on, and report progress on multiple fronts. Someone who isn&#8217;t entrenched in any particular function, department, or silo. Someone who can continually investigate and communicate. Someone that is a full-time employee, as opposed to a consultant. That person is the embedded journalist.

This role has been around to a certain degree, as it pertains to internal communications and public relations. And that&#8217;s great! It&#8217;s just that we need individuals inside organizations, hired to investigate and report. The [Environmental Defense Fund](http://edf.org) has a program called [Climate Corps](http://edfclimatecorps.org/) that sends fellows to Fortune 1000 companies to help save thousands or millions of dollars by finding ways to reduce energy consumption in buildings. This is just one example. I&#8217;ve heard stories of individuals as part of &#8220;green teams&#8221; to do the same thing, though these were primarily volunteer company programs.

Do you have any similar examples or stories to share? What are your thoughts on the embedded journalist?
