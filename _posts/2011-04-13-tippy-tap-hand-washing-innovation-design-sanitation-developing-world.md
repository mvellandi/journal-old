Great video production! Oops, I should probably be talking about the actual situation of how helping to foster sanitation, we can lower the amount of disease contractions in the developing world. As shown, the innovative method of building a hand washing station deserves big props. Here&#8217;s the official description:

> *&#8220;Diarrheal and respiratory infections kill over 3.5 million children under the age of five every year. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and an inexpensive way to prevent these deaths. It can save the lives of 1.2 million children every year.*
>
> *The tippy tap is a low cost, low tech, low water, hands-free device to promote hand washing with soap.*

> *<a href="http://www.tippytap.org/">Tippytap.org</a> is a partnership between WMG (<a href="http://www.watershedmg.org/">www.watershedmg.org</a>) and Grampari (<a href="http://www.grampari.org/">www.grampari.org</a>)&#8221;*
