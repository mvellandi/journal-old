A couple EcoCradle samples roaming around the audience

Recently at an event hosted by [Columbia University&#8217;s Sustainability Management program](http://ce.columbia.edu/Sustainability-Management), I heard from Sam Harrington, Environmental Director and Design Engineer at [Ecovative](http://www.ecovativedesign.com/), who spoke about some of the neat things they&#8217;re doing. [See these 2 quick videos](../sustainable-insulation-building-materials-ecovative-innovation/) (I promise they&#8217;re short and cool!) if you&#8217;re not familar with the company.<figure id="attachment_6780" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

I got a sample to take home!

So one of the neat updates that Sam shared was [Steelcase&#8217;s](http://www.steelcase.com/) interest in developing a sturdy material that could be used in place of [particle board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_board). If a client as big as them was interested in the technology, maybe it was possible. The Ecovative team sure has the R&D capability to potentially develop a strong composite material from natural sources. A breakthrough could be massive, considering the amount of bad chemicals that go into particle board and gradually offgas.

We&#8217;ll just have to see what happens ðŸ™‚
