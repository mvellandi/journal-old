I recently saw this documentary film at the Pratt Institute. Wow! I&#8217;d heard about fracking, as industry professionals call it, but never knew what it was all about. [See the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing) and this recent [Science Daily story](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110411103724.htm) for some fair coverage. Here&#8217;s the trailer:

What I particularly liked was the filmmaker&#8217;s style. Objective, caring, and nonpartisan. Emotionally touching was how families all over the country just couldn&#8217;t use their tap water anymore, and were being physically harmed over time. While it may be argued that with proper geological surveying and drilling, fracking may pose no clear and immediate human health threat, the opportunity to make lots of money fast can easily turn eyes blind toward proper procedures and negative environmental externalities.
