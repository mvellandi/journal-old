The [Pratt Design Incubator](http://incubator.pratt.edu/) is a very cool undertaking from an academic institution, helping designers and entrepreneurs develop & launch their sustainable innovation projects. Having visited recently for a reception and spoken to some participants, I&#8217;m happy for the assistance it&#8217;s providing. Here&#8217;s some info about Debera:

> *&#8220;Debera Johnson has been a catalyst for transformative change at <a href="http://www.pratt.edu/">Pratt Institute</a> for more than 20 years and a lifetime advocate for collaboration. She currently is the Academic Director of Sustainability at Pratt Institute and is leading Pratt’s commitment to integrate sustainability through its academic programs.&#8221;*
