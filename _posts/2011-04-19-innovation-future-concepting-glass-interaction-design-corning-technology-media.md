Another neat future concept video on screen interfaces everywhere. Honestly, it&#8217;s a little scary to me. Human beings should not be meant for that much multitasking! However, in many scenarios it can be quite helpful, though I&#8217;d rather trust a personal handheld device to help me out when I need it. As one blogger amusingly put it though: &#8220;Invest in Windex now!&#8221; ðŸ˜€
