[Bill Verplank](http://www.billverplank.com/professional.html) is a smart gent with many years of experience in human factors engineering, innovation, and design. There&#8217;s a LOT of cognitive science in the presentation, making it pretty high level material on one hand, but very concrete on another since it&#8217;s narrated through illustrations. He shows us various paradigms into interaction design, including a good history of the practice since working at Xerox in the late 70s.
