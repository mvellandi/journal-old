Having learned a couple weeks ago about the creative collective known as [Digital DUMBO](http://www.digitaldumbo.com/), I eagerly signed up to attend one of their upcoming events on April 28th. It looked to be fun and worthwhile since I&#8217;m looking to meet other folks passionate about new media during my job exploration phase. But first, I had to meet up with my new pal Mitch Baranowski of [BBMG](http://bbmg.com/), an agency member of the community. After some early testing on a new micro-journalism format, I made the following prototype about Digital DUMBO as a newbie introduction to what the community is all about. Enjoy!

That was James Brown&#8217;s &#8220;Think&#8221; playing in the background music ðŸ™‚

Production took about 3 hours. Identifying the bottlenecks now and learning to increase the turnaround time. To me, this is an experiment in speed & quality. Look out for more coming soon&#8230;
