At a recent nonprofit technology seminar, I met up with Charles Lenchner of [Organizing 2.0](http://www.organizing20.org/) and asked him on the real deal behind online petitions, and how to identify those limited few that could make an impact. His background in advocacy and online campaigning make him a trusted authority in the field, and since these topics are quite related to marketing and asking people to take action, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll appreciate the insights he shares.

This is a new concept media piece I developed for podcasts. Although it&#8217;s just audio, I do feel that the format is more interesting than just a tiny rectangular audio player on screen, as is seen on many webpages. To me, it&#8217;s more concrete, visible, and attractive. From an experience perspective, it&#8217;s similar to that of NPR or another broadcaster that offers podcasts through an integrated player that opens in a popup window, although I&#8217;d like to think mine is more aesthetically appealing from a graphic design perspective ðŸ˜›
