Very cool business concept that addresses the Kenyan energy market, while addressing deforestation. For me, this is a concrete example of how we&#8217;ll need to be creative with nature, sometimes introducing foreign species and solutions that will allow the ecosystem and biome to positively adapt. Here&#8217;s the video description:

> *&#8220;Tevis Howard founded <a href="http://www.komaza.org/">KOMAZA</a> to help end extreme poverty for rural Kenyan families living in arid landscapes. The organization partners with poor families to plant high-profit commercial tree farms that generate life-changing income and help preserve indigenous biodiversity.&#8221;*
