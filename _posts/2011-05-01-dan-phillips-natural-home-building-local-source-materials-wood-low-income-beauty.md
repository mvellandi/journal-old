Can homes be made cheaply, the materials sourced from the local area, **AND** be beautiful? I liked this short presentation mostly for the amount of visuals and creativity that went into the homes&#8217; construction. It&#8217;d be great to know that your home is truly one of a kind, with a feel that is natural and well, woody 🙂 Here&#8217;s the description:

He seeks to prove that constructing homes with recycled and salvaged materials has a viable place in the building industry.&#8221;*
