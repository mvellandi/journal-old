Leading neuropsychiatrist [Peter Whybrow](http://www.peterwhybrow.com/) is the author of [“American Mania: When More Is Not Enough,”](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039332849X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=039332849X) a neurobiological look at the instinctual and social behaviors that balance a market economy. He explains how America’s reward-driven culture is pushing the physiological limits of our evolutionary inheritance.

What I liked about this presentation is the amount of scientific details he provides into our brain and how we think. Enjoy!
