In his book &#8220;[What Technology Wants](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670022152/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0670022152)&#8220;, Kevin Kelly takes us on a philosophical and historical journey of innovation. Its origins, its inherent nature, its relationship with us. By personifying the word technology and asking us to look at the bigger picture of writing, tools, science, methods of thought and action, we can understand it as a persistent entity.

Both matter and sentient life want to diversify and improve their own operational effectiveness. Through evolution and directed guidance from humans, nature, and the laws of physics.

If that feels a bit heady, you&#8217;ll understand why I&#8217;ll stop short here. Kevin&#8217;s contribution to appreciating technology and innovation is remarkable, and I highly recommend those with a passion for these subjects and for sociology to read it. For everyone else, I suggest going to your bookstore and reading just one chapter: &#8220;Lessons of Amish Hackers&#8221;.

How does technology affect our relationships with others? What impact is its use having within our families and community? The Amish really care about these topics, and technology is therefore judged within this lens. Can the same benefit be realized through other means? If not, can we modify its form or usage patterns so as not to negatively affect our existing way of life?

I think this is something we all need to periodically ask, while adopting a mindset of what I call: Selective Engagement for Enrichment.
