Interesting presentation on incorporating new media skills in journalism students. Having self-studied and practiced information architecture, web/graphic design, audio/video editing, and other subjects over the last 10 years, I appreciate what it has given me as a marketer. For budding young journalists, one must have a bit of sympathy and hope for them, considering the massive restructuring of the media and news publishing industry. But whether we&#8217;re talking about marketers, journalists, or information designers, the fact is that either digital skills or a strong working knowledge thereof is a vital asset for both young professionals and mid-level executives. Either for being entrepreneurial and getting a great project done since production/distribution barriers have lowered, and competition heightened. Or for situational assessments, audits, understanding future trends, effectively speaking with creative staff & consultants, and conceptually bringing forth viable ideas&#8230;faster.

That&#8217;s the advantage that new media skills and knowledge brings to people across industries in communications roles. And it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m continuing somehow to better learn & practice. My dad was an electrical engineer, tinkerer, and entrepreneur. In my own way, I&#8217;d like to follow the footsteps he took. Along with some new friends exploring the same path. One not taken before because it is so new, and because we&#8217;re sitting at a wonderful intersection of media, communications, and awesome digital tech that&#8217;s transforming existing industries, allowing combinations of others, while opening up new entrepreneurial opportunities that are just skimming the surface of what&#8217;s possible.

Here&#8217;s the official video description:

> *&#8220;Steven Johnson was an editor and senior online producer at the Los Angeles Times for 7 years before joining Disney Online in 2007. For 5 years he has taught as an adjunct in the M.A. journalism program at USC&#8217;s Annenberg School of Communications, where a fundamental shift is underway in the program&#8217;s new media curriculum.&#8221;*
