In film, there is a pure guided experience for the audience. They&#8217;re bound to the timeline. In interaction design though, we&#8217;re dealing with proceeding forward (or back) through a variety of choices, screen by screen. Limiting those choices altogether or by hiding them through menu calls, allows greater focus (similar to video games).

A few months ago, I watched [Adam Connor](http://adamconnor.com/) speak about [applying film making tools to interaction design](http://vimeo.com/21368215). As is my custom to take notes, here I share them. While they&#8217;re staccato in nature, I think you can pick up the ideas easily.

### The Filmmaking Process

  * Screenplay & Script
  * Storyboards & Design
  * Raw Footage
  * Final Edited Film

Within the screenplay, __<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28filmmaking%29">beat sheets</a>__ provide a scene-by-scene outline including:

  * Plot Points
  * Actions
  * Effect on Audience (ex: drama, laughter, shock)

### Use in Interaction Design?

The Software Design Process includes:

  * Task Flows
  * Sketches / Wireframes
  * Prototype & Visual Designs
  * Final Developed Product

How do we keep emotion in the forefront of the design process?

  * Make Scenario Descriptions Rich: better though at describing the &#8220;initial&#8221; rather than the &#8220;end&#8221; state.
  * Comics: Do well in communicating emotion, but suffer from a lack of longevity as reference points by developers.

Using Annotated Task Flows as Beat Sheets:

  * Emotional state of the user (actual)
  * Emotional goals of the system (desired)

### Communication

**[Mise en Sc√®ne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_Scene)**: Set Design, Lighting, Staging, Acting, Costume

**Motion**: How does motion communicate? It has the ability to reduce latency in an interaction. Ex: Dragging items from one area of a screen to another, as means of reordering items, or adding an item to a shopping cart.

Early filmmakers didn&#8217;t have sound, dialogue or color. Speech/title cards were used as little as possible.

But there&#8217;s always been **Flow** in motion graphics.

Common directions and their associated emotional impact:

Left to Right: **Normal**

Right to Left: **Antagonistic**

Top to Bottom: **Inevitable force**

Bottom to Top: **Covering up**

**Camera** &#8211; Variety of techniques to direct attention

**Rack Focus** &#8211; Little to no camera movement, No complex actions, Camera shifts depth of field focus from one element to another.
