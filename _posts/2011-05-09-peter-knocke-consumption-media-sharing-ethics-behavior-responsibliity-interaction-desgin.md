After listening to Peter&#8217;s story, I was able to empathize with the behaviors he&#8217;s describing as part of the media landscape of consumption and sharing. More importantly, it speaks to ethics. A responsibility that we as marketers and designers have toward society. There needs to be balance.

Here&#8217;s the official description:

> *&#8220;Peter Knocke is an Interaction Designer / Business Strategist / Obsessive Foodie. From growing up in a quiet Midwestern farm town to hopping around the globe, he has always closely observed how people live, work, and interact with each other. After studying business in the United States and design in Italy, he spends his days building web sites, mobile platforms, interactive installations and strategic roadmaps. Currently, he has dedicated his life to writing, speaking, and designing for projects that encourage a better balance of friends, family, life, and work.&#8221;*
