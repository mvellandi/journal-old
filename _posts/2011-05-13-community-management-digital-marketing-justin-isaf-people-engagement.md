Interview with [Justin Isaf](http://justinisaf.com/), Community Manager at The Huffington Post, and formerly of [Change.org](http://www.change.org/). I ask him why there&#8217;s no such thing as **_&#8220;managing&#8221;_** a community, and how marketing is an essential aspect of engaging with people. However in that regard, any promotional messaging has to be mixed in among other outbound communications, so people don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re being **_&#8220;marketed to&#8221;_**.
