A group of peers and I discussed last month what we envisioned as the future of the green movement and a (more) sustainable society. While there was no definitive conclusion, there was a healthy bit of realism thrown on the table for us to chew on.

### Social Media

Yes, it can be a great platform for collectively raising **Awareness** of issues through nonprofit/ngo/brand publishing, user-generated content & distribution, discussions, and word-of-mouth through blogs and other sharing options.

While awareness is good, **Action** is what marketers and change agents want to inspire. **Real** action that is. Not [slacktivism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism) that allows easy options like reTweeting a message, liking a Facebook page, or playing a trivia game that also donates rice to developing world kids. Social media for good should encourage meaningful calls to action, not just make people believe they&#8217;re supporting a cause through passive activity, thus making them feel better. That&#8217;s undifferentiated, non-competitive, non-memorable bs that all communicators should rise above. Know the difference and spread the word to those leading such campaigns. Because that energy people are devoting toward good intentions should be viable in the long run, not sapped dry like the large number of small business or new products that fail.

Secondly, it seems to me that at a certain point in media channel observation, there&#8217;s grows to be a echo chamber of recurring ideas. The media industry and budding passionate bloggers are the worst offenders. Top 7 tips to a stronger CSR, product launch, employee retention, energy savings, or vibrant garden anyone? That&#8217;s just a snapshot of advice article formats. Then there&#8217;s Twitter, Facebook, and other channels that are distributing these similar stories, along with providing pithy advice in 140 characters.

I admit that observing what other people in my smart acquaintance network are talking about or sharing can be really interesting, especially for case studies. But there are limits to both what we realistically have time to learn about, pseudo-interact with these folks with passive kudos and occasional mini-dialogue, and hell, what&#8217;s practical and meaningful in the long run.

Is this virtual dialogue and affinitive high-fiving helping make an actual difference in the world? I think 99.9% of the time it doesn&#8217;t. But participating is sure fun anyway. Is there a personal benefit at least? I think learning more about the world, various disciplines and cultures, and getting to know more &#8220;truly&#8221; interesting people that could be beneficial to our network somewhere down the line is important. But these same activities could also be accomplished by reading books and going to social events (much easier if you live in a big city).

To me, all these activities whether online or off, can serve to personally enrich oneself and others. Awareness, learning, interpersonal connection is important. But they don&#8217;t provide the type of change in the world that **real work and action** does.

With that said, what actionable benefit does social media serve for the future of green, csr, etc.? Well, the social streams work as word-of-mouth carriers of organic messages oftentimes with links, and sometimes calls to action. If those calls are directing people into a funnel for donations, sales, petitions, activity signups, pledges, content or software downloads, and anything else deemed as meaningful, then we can say social media is being utilized to a good extent.

Nonetheless, awareness is important if we want a large volume of intended action. And that requires promotion, listening, and outreach. PR. Buzz is good, especially if it helps significantly shape attitudes and opinions. But even so, **that** type of influential messaging still has an intended effect on the audience. Not all awareness campaigns do that well.

### Can We Really Expect Others to Care about Sustainability as Much as We Do?

Ha! Well if we want to open that big bag of ethical behavior, we might as well talk about how human rights, fair trade & wages, gender/racial/age diversity in workplaces and public office, corruption, the educational system, healthcare, veteran care, privacy, and a massive slew of other topics that are calling for people&#8217;s attention and actions from the heart.

People have other priorities in life including work, personal health, finance, education, love, family, friends, recreation, and hobbies. Given that reality, I think it&#8217;s damn well impossible for individuals to have enough of an impact in their purchasing behavior, lifestyles, and any advocacy actions taken to influence the ecological/social impact of others, business, and government policies. Voting and community participation on a local level can have an influence there. But it&#8217;s still small.

Business & Design are the real influencers. Politics is too slow, and the decrepit average mindset of American conservatives on sustainability issues and climate change is snail&#8217;s pace to change due to the unfortunate cognitive &#8220;positioning&#8221; with Al Gore (bless his soul), and the associated &#8220;leftist&#8221; connotations it triggers there. (By the way, I&#8217;m apolitical in case you&#8217;re wondering). Plus, there are too many other issues on politicians&#8217; plates and little time to spare for green issues.

### The American Lifestyle and Footprint

Compared to other nations, it&#8217;s huge. While I&#8217;ll be quick to admit that our population density per square mile is very low in comparison to other countries like Germany and China, and that this entails much higher carbon footprints in addition to other ecological inefficiencies of suburban lives and car cultures, our history and way of life is also very much to blame. The manufacturing powerhouse nation that fostered easy home ownership, cheap food, convenient living based on too-easy credit, old agricultural policies, throwaway/open-loop material systems is now realizing the limits to growth. Increasing senior populations, fewer deaths, fewer babies, increasing personal debt, higher cost of education, and an inflation rate growing faster than income should eventually force this nation into smart growth mode. Somehow, I&#8217;m afraid that the American culture is in a state of denial about this, and it&#8217;ll take a very long time for meaningful change to happen.

What I&#8217;m more afraid of though, is the ecological impact that the aspired American lifestyle will have on the rest of the developing world. Part of me believes that increased natural resource demand is simply going to force higher prices around the world, and the Western countries are going to have to adjust appropriately as a result of the macro political/economic force that BRIC&#8217;s collusion and their individual foreign direct investment is going to have on global economics.

As average wages rise abroad, so will the price of imported goods. This should theoretically encourage operational efficiencies and new ways of running a profitable enterprise. Secondly, I believe Americans will gradually awaken to the impact that over-consumption has on personal debt and savings levels. Personal & familial health and finances are the key factors that will influence behavior change. Seems logical. At the same time though, I deeply believe that easy credit and the unhealthy lifestyle of most Americans in terms of nutrition and exercise, will continue giving people a reason to indulge in the present and neglect the morrow.

### Hope

Engineering and Design serve mankind to innovate better processes and outcomes. Disseminated knowledge of discoveries, applications, successes, and failures inspire designers to change their approach, and investors to contribute funding.

Just how people like to do what others are doing where it concerns maximizing happiness, businesses like to copy what others are doing to increase revenue and lower operating costs. Case studies emerge, they end up in MBA programs, books, and the media. Management consultancies like McKinsey, Deloitte, KPMG, and other agencies will analyze & optimize. Some will innovate and become pioneers.

If we&#8217;re looking just at the materials economy, smart companies are realizing savings from nonvirgin/upcycled procurement, and recycling or selling scrap. Waste Management is putting a LOT of money into this industry, while investors scratch their heads and competitors continue investing in landfills. Startups like RecycleMatch are addressing the B2B marketplace, while RecycleBank is fairly rewarding people for the lost monetary value in their trash.

[The Access economy](../future-sharing-renting-physical-assets-technology-lisa-gansky/) is another one that confers the same benefits to participants, without the high cost of ownership (purchase price, depreciation, non-utility).

I imagine a future of green of continuous positive change. One where Design is the beacon, and Business the engine.
