People **don&#8217;t** want Simplicity. They **want** Uncomplicated.

That&#8217;s an essential principle of designing products and applications. If we patronize people as being simple-minded and strip out advanced features entirely, then surely we can lower development costs and increase time to market. But the downside is that such a product doesn&#8217;t allow people to become intermediate or advanced users. And you&#8217;re also excluding that expanded market audience (sales opportunity cost).

It&#8217;d be nice if we could have the best of both worlds. Sometimes that&#8217;s possible, other times not. But within our creative capacity to do so, we can try.

So Josh Clark lively talks about these subjects in the context of mobile application design. It&#8217;s a fun watch; one that prompted me to download the Accuweather iPhone application to hands down beat the standard Yahoo app.
