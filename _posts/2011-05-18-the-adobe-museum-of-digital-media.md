The [Adobe Museum of Digital Media](http://www.adobemuseum.com/index.php) is a neat concept, although there are only two active exhibits: A presentation by John Maeda on digital media history, and Tony Oursler&#8217;s interactive abstract art on various subjects.

While I can imagine various ways they could improve the attendee experience, these are primarily reserved for larger venues with more pieces to show. However, given the amount of great work that&#8217;s being done out there by artists, I&#8217;m sure Adobe could expand the museum fairly quickly. Yet to do so would require an extreme mindset of usability and navigation so to maximize site exploration and word of mouth.

A couple quick tools that come to mind would be a readily available Map icon on the side, which when pulled up would indicate where we &#8220;Are&#8221; in terms of exhibit category, and what else there is to see within each. Another icon would be for Info (exhibit and producer details), as well as a foot icon for Moving On to the next exhibit, since in real life we have that easy ability to continue browsing the rest of what&#8217;s available to see. That&#8217;s an affordance that is absolutely necessary online because with one click to close a tab or the browser itself, we&#8217;ve &#8220;left&#8221;, and the rest of the museum is forgone to viewing.

While that action may be the result of frustration, boredom, or simply having other things to do, it introduces another function worth having: locational saving and sharing. Right now the individual exhibits don&#8217;t have unique URLs, which affords users to jump back to that content. Since the museum is currently tiny, that&#8217;s not a big deal. But if it were to significantly expand, that would definitely be a needed feature.

Check out Maeda&#8217;s presentation, even if you can&#8217;t watch the whole thing. There is a certain beauty and visceral engagement factor that TED talks and other video lectures just can&#8217;t provide. Secondly, there&#8217;s a small degree of interactivity available too, with the inclusion of a multiple choice question that John poses at one point. It&#8217;s not overly remarkable, but it does show the distinct limitations that broadcast-only lectures have, regardless of the production quality or topic.
