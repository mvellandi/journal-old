Recently received this outreach from the [United Nations Environment Program on World Environment Day](http://www.unep.org/wed/), June 6th. This year, they&#8217;re celebrating the ecosystem benefits that forests provide. Here&#8217;s the video:

Totally dig the animation combined with narration at a moderate pace. And thank-god it wasn&#8217;t a long series of animated text with a heartwarming/other soundtrack background.

Here&#8217;s the campaign description I received via email:

> *&#8220;Dear WED Partners,*
>
> *In 2010, we launched the WED Legacy Project. The goal? To get as many individuals and organizations as possible to identify an activity or pledge an action and register on the site to build a global WED community and make a significant contribution in the host country. The result? We pledged $10 for every registration, and the community came through, contributing over $100,000 to gorilla protection in Rwanda. Watch our site for the WED Legacy Gorilla Diary which introduces the gorillas of Rwanda to the WED community.*
>
> *The 2011 WED Legacy drive continues and this time features an exciting, high-profile, challenge between UNEP Goodwill Ambassadors Don Cheadle and Gisele Bündchen.*
>
> *Full of goodwill, Gisele pledges to plant one tree for every activity registered in her name. Full of confidence, Don Cheadle ups the ante with a pledge for two. On June 5th, with help from the global WED community, the winner will plant a new forest and leave the perfect WED Legacy for the UN International Year of Forests.*
>
> *To participate, watch the videos on the WED website and then via the WED Challenge page, register your activities and vote for Team Don or Team Gisele! Watch for the launch of the “behind-the-scenes” challenge viral video on Tonic, starting May 24th.*
>
> *Join us in celebrating World Environment Day by mobilizing participation in your area! Download and embed our videos on your website, Facebook or Twitter pages!&#8221;*

I really like the campaign concept, but somehow think there&#8217;s either too much information [on the website](http://www.unep.org/wed/) or not enough easy calls to focused action. Maybe I&#8217;m spoiled by well-designed mobile applications now, in turn making me less patient than before. However if half of all great writing is editing, then it should hold true for web content as well.

As a marketer, I&#8217;m cognizant of the fact that Earth Day was fairly recent, and therefore WED has to heavily focus on the topic of forests, so that people don&#8217;t just perceive it as another environmental day. There&#8217;s more to be said, though I have to get going. See ya!
