An interesting subject emerging over the last couple years in therapy and behavior change is Games. Whether we&#8217;re talking any range of them based on skills, intellect, or chance, good ones keep people engaged and interested. And these last two user states is what we marketers love! ðŸ™‚ So, there are definitely elements of game play that can be deployed throughout the user experience design of products and services.

Can you imagine perhaps how banks could reward you with points for certain behaviors you&#8217;ve taken, that may also be in their interest? I think in subtle ways, games can be all around us. But just like in product development, most will fail. A few will succeed. And since brands&#8217; business isn&#8217;t in selling games, their incentive to trial, measure, and improve will be low.

So I found this neat presentation about this subject by a gent I follow on Twitter, shown below. Next week I&#8217;ll be at a meetup regarding this topic as well, and hope to bring back some neat insights.
