[Neat interactive game for Range Rover](http://www.helloevoque.com/beinghenry). I&#8217;m not quite sure if something similar would be possible with HTML5 and Javascript, though suppose it could be if there&#8217;s a video event attribute for &#8220;finished&#8221;, a sniffer for such states which then commands overlaid with images/text links at specific x/y coordinates, which then load corresponding new videos.

Anyways, I recommend trying it out yourself for fun. I think this format has **MASSIVE** potential for user-engagement&#8230;though of course you&#8217;d guess rightly so that I&#8217;m talking about communications rather than product marketing. It wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have to have a gaming element though. Just the option to dynamically experience the everyday work of an employee/volunteer (for recruiting), a beneficiary (for donations), and the list goes on. This is video storytelling squared. Give me the funding and an interactive agency that can produce it NOT in Flash&#8230;let&#8217;s go! 🙂

Here&#8217;s a bit of the PR pitcher&#8217;s description sent to me:

> *&#8220;Land Rover has released its first ever film, designed to generate awareness for a vehicle debuting this fall – the all-new 2012 Range Rover Evoque. “Being Henry” is an interactive online film that is all about “choices” and brings to life the unprecedented variety of options available with the Evoque. Leo Fitzpatrick of The Wire plays Henry throughout the film’s nine different story lines and 32 potential endings, under the award-winning direction of Nick Gordon. Viewers of the short film have the opportunity to make Henry’s choices, via a choose-your-own-adventure style interaction; ultimately, the choices made by the viewer on Henry’s behalf translate into their perfect car. Very subtle color, situational and emotional references in each choice ultimately result in the creation of the viewer’s perfect Range Rover Evoque, revealed at the end of the storyline.&#8221;*
