Isn&#8217;t it great when campaign stories zag to begin with? This creative piece does just that; produced for [Friends of the Earth UK](http://www.foe.co.uk/). Humor, joy, hope, and other emotions are what make advocacy communications stand out. So long as they don&#8217;t stray too far, try to be witty, or don&#8217;t end appropriately and the essential message is lost on the viewer. Anyways&#8230;enjoy!
