To rehearse:

  1. **Transparency & Honesty** &#8211; Knowing yourself and being honest with others is the only way to progress forward.
  2. **Biopolymers** &#8211; In an ideal world they&#8217;d be ubiquitous. Utilize them where their performance, cost, and system effects can warrant them.
  3. **Rethink Waste** &#8211; Look for non-virgin material inputs and consider how manufacturing waste can be reused, repurposed, or sold.
  4. **Ask Nature** &#8211; Efficiency and zero waste is nature&#8217;s modus operandi. Ask &#8220;what would nature do?&#8221;
  5. **Quantification** &#8211; Only a Life Cycle Assessment will tell you what the lowest eco-impact on different indicators will be. Use it where possible.
  6. **Integrate into your Entire Process** &#8211; To save the most money and generate the best product concept, start early**.
  7. **Never Assume** &#8211; Don&#8217;t judge a product or material by its properties or form, and don&#8217;t trust what a manufacturer says it is. Think for yourself based on knowledge and sound judgment.
