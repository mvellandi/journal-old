[Kelly McDonald](http://www.mcdonaldmarketing.com/ "Kelly McDonald's website") wrote [this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470879009/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0470879009 "Amazon link to Kelly's marketing book") I read recently that provides the principles of marketing along with tactics to understand and communicate with a whole variety of demographic, cultural, and values-based market segments. The nice thing about it was that although I wasn&#8217;t the target audience (being a marketing nerd), it seemed **very** approachable for small to medium sized businesses on the principles part, and insightful on the cultural part for every conceivable reader who picks this up.

In this day and age, **every** business owner can expand their sales by better understanding the potential client market base, and communicating with them in ways that are culturally relevant, meaningful, and appropriate too. Language, imagery, and approaches used with different market segments can fall flat because of a lack of empathy and understanding. Sometimes, they can be downright demeaning too if they&#8217;re based on stereotypes. Just like for online marketing, a single marketing approach is lame due to the large opportunity to precisely target prospects with unique needs.

This is a handbook that every business owner and corporate marketer (for the cultural training insights) should read due to its breadth, brevity, solid advice, and great stories. I particularly liked the chapter on immigrants, the acculturation process, and segmentation thereof. Check out the [table of contents on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0470879009/ref=sib_dp_ptu#reader-link "table of contents on Amazon") for a topical overview.

**Note:** I received this book as a review copy and have made my best efforts to be objective about its value to potential readers. It was a fun read ðŸ™‚
