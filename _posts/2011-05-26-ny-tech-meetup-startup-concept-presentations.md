[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7036" style="margin: 15px 20px;" title="new york ny tech meetup" src="/images/2011/new-york-ny-tech-meetup.jpg" alt="new york ny tech meetup logo" width="202" height="150" />](http://nytm.org/)So earlier this month, I attended my first [NY Tech Meetup event](http://nytm.org/) and was impressed by the various presenters&#8217; work. Sometimes they were just really cool concepts. Others were startups. Getting a ticket isn&#8217;t hard, but they sell out really fast so you have to act fast on 3 window slots they offer with a set number of tickets. Here&#8217;s my notes from the noteworthy examples:

### Etsy Shopping Network

The concept was a browsing application for [Etsy.com](http://www.etsy.com/) that would work on your net-enabled TV, in this case, GoogleTV. Without a visual, the easiest way to describe it would be a vertical product category menu bar on the left, and a huge image on the right. Clicking a category would bring up various items for sale, with the option for item-level views too. It took about 20 hours to build and is a viewing app only, as the Etsy API (and very few others) allow for transactions.

### ComeAtMeBro

Instead of trying to use Twitter for finding & engaging with people you like, [BroComeAt.me](http://brocomeat.me/) is an engine that tries to match people with dissimilar interests in an effort to provoke verbal online fights. Included are suggested insults ðŸ™‚

### Uber

Startup for a [black car taxi service in NYC](http://www.uber.com/), which connects signed up drivers with registered users who have their credit card info stored online. Accessed through a mobile app from iPhone and Android, or via SMS, users can see available drivers, set a destination, and request a pickup. This then sends a message to the nearest available driver with a status as &#8220;on duty&#8221;, who then has 15 seconds to accept or decline. An accepted pickup then sends the user a picture of the driver, their ETA, and an option to call the driver if necessary for additional details. One neat thing is that both passengers and drivers can rate each other through the service for feedback.

### Clique

A [dating website for friends-of-friends](http://cliqueinnyc.com/). Facebook profile info is pulled in (opt-in), with additional social feed integration opportunities. When viewing someone&#8217;s profile, one can see how you&#8217;re connected to them, similar to how LinkedIn shows degrees of separation. Lastly, there&#8217;s a Wingman profile feature for those non-daters who&#8217;d like to play matchmaker, for which there&#8217;s an actual game with yes and no answers.

### RezScore

[Personal resume grading service](http://rezscore.com/) based on brevity, impact, and depth. After an analysis, it provides you with a summary, tips for improvement, and strongest keywords. Kind of like [Grader.com](http://grader.com/) for websites.

### MatchBook

This is a useful app that I downloaded and liked for its utility. Have you ever jotted down a place you&#8217;d like to visit someday in your city or area? [This takes care of it all for you with a beautiful user interface](http://matchbookit.com/), categorize your bookmarks (mostly food, dining, and nightlife in NYC), map integration, tagging, and the ability to alert you if you happen to be nearby. Also syncs with your computer if you&#8217;d like to user the web interface, for which there&#8217;s a bookmarklet. Very useful, since I don&#8217;t have to put this info in my Notes application anymore.

### ShoutEm

Ever wanted to make a mobile app which you can easily update, without all the pain of hiring a developer and distributing updates? [This service does just that](http://www.shoutem.com/). In some regards, I&#8217;d almost liken them as the Worpress for mobile apps. As of now, it seems best targeted for three types of end users: fans, artists, and news readers. Select the modules you want, background photo and 5-6 others for graphics, and a preferred layout. It provides realtime updates to the app without new downloads from the App Store. Subsequent application change approvals with Apple is handled by them.

### Bridg.me

A [conference call service](http://bridg.me/) that automatically calls and connects you in. No manual dial in and codes needed. As their slogan goes, _&#8220;Never be late for another conference call.&#8221;_ Just set up the date and time in advance; data stored through Google Calendar. The concept was built in 48 hours on the [Twilio platform](http://www.twilio.com/), including the API, PBX, etc. If you miss the call, it&#8217;ll keep trying to call you back! ðŸ™‚

### Shelby.tv

[Easily discover and share web videos](http://shelby.tv/). Sign-in with Twitter or Facebook. Pulls from various online providers, includes a great user-interface without the usual page clutter, and videos can be commented on through your social networks. As of now, they&#8217;re in alpha testing and will be optimizing their service for the web first, then [Boxee](http://www.boxee.tv/) and [GoogleTV](http://www.google.com/tv/).

### Urtak

[A better way to find out what people think](http://urtak.com/). As a CMS plugin (or 3rd party service?) it lets everyone (publisher or audience) contribute a question on a webpage, with the option to answer as yes, no, or &#8220;don&#8217;t care&#8221;. The premise and claims are that 10x as many people will participate in comparison to leaving a comment, since user participation is dead simple. Allows publishers to create, collect, organize the info, use the service as a widget or on individual posts, and the ability to moderate user-contributed questions before going live. Service already in use by Newsweek among others including a big Colombian media co. too.
