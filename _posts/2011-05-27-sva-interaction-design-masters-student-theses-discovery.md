So earlier this month, I attended the [MFA Interaction Design Festival](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/events/entry/open_ixd/), which showcased Masters of Fine Arts student theses projects at the [School of Visual Arts in NYC](http://sva.edu). In all, I was taken away by the high amount of humanistic ideas put forward by the students. This post covers the first of four themes: __Discovery__.

### Orbit

[Clint Beharry](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/students/profile/clint_beharry/ "Clint Beharry") gave us [Orbit](http://leftrightoutput.com/orbit/), *&#8220;an application for researchers to explore the universe of their data and discover new ideas. Most research apps today are built around boring spreadsheets and lists, with no engaging exploration of data, and no support for creative ideation. Theorizing beyond those constraints, Orbit renders an immersive 3D planetary system based on your research websites, videos, images, and documents. Exploring the planets of media reveals content similarities and differences, potentially sparking new ideas in your research.&#8221;*

Visit the link to see how the solar system looked like. Neat thing was wearing these 3d glasses to see it all in action.

### Postgeist

[Kristin Gräfe](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/students/profile/kristin_graefe/ "Kristin Gräfe") explained her app as follows. *&#8220;The large amount of digital data we leave behind can possibly exist for eternity, raising questions of curation, ownership and storage. With “<a href="http://postgeist.com/">Postgeist</a>” the user is collecting a digital legacy to bequeath material and immaterial things to their family and close friends to create long-lasting memories. The heirs are encouraged to explore those pictures, thoughts and stories through objects, place and time. A digital legacy will be built and becomes a bridge to connect family generations over time.&#8221;*

### Hobnobber

[Angela Huang](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/students/profile/angela_huang/ "Angela Huang") presented [Hobnobber](http://cargocollective.com/hobnobber) as a service that encourages individuals who acknowledge shyness and social anxiety to practice social skills by experiencing face to face social situations. Individuals can choose from levels of social activities to complete on location, at events, or anywhere they feel comfortable. They will be notify by Hobnobber when practice opportunities arise. By self-reporting, individuals can also track their progress and receive rewards. Mostly, the system helps them with actionable goals and making small improvements on weekly bases. Upon accomplishing these activities, they may be more confident and comfortable in offline setting.

This one showed us the potential that therapy-oriented interactive mobile software can have. That market is freakin&#8217; HUGE! Whether for substance abuse, couples therapy, or [DSM (mental disorders)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders), mobile applications that provide educational material, guidance, games, and more for personal use or in conjunction with a specialist, can be super beneficial and make a LOT of money for the publishers.

### Story Forest

[Gene Lu](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/students/profile/gene_lu/ "Gene Lu")&#8216;s application allows users to turn their city *&#8220;into a forest of experiences by sharing and replaying your memories where they were made.&#8221;* Features & benefits include: Record photos, text messages, and audio; Immersive, location-based storytelling; Tag your family and friends.
