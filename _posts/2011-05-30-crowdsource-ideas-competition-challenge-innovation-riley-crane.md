Another cool video I found&#8230;

> *&#8220;Riley Crane, a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="http://media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a>, found out about the DARPA Red Balloon Challenge four days before it started (find ten balloons placed in ten different locations around the country). Four days, eight hours, and 52 minutes later his team had won the competition. Watch him talk about how they did it and the challenges they encountered in the process.&#8221;*

Particularly funny was how the team encountered intentionally fake balloon sightings to throw them off, and how they simply screened out locations not matching senders&#8217; originating IP addresses.
