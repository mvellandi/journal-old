Sometimes I want to physically shake people and ask them to wake up to reality. Not often, but for the sake of humanity and opportunity cost of energy spent. Last month, I read a great investigative journalism piece on the absurdity that some folks will go to with sharing status updates and social networks. Not within society, as there&#8217;s obsessive compulsive and neurotic people of every kind anyway ðŸ™‚ But rather within the tech idea and startup development scene. I recommend you check it out:

Particularly poignant was how these folks&#8217; brilliance was being spent for a subculture that is very well alive and kicking. Continuing because ample funding is available, technological progress and experimentation are valued for the R&D insights in and of themselves, and because a shared dreamy hope is maintained by competitive inertia.

I prefer reading and sharing stories of progress above ourselves.
