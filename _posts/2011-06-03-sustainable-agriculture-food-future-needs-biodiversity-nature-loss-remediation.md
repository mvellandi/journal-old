I say &#8220;Feast&#8221;, but with a wide variety of options in small serving sizes. After all, food is so much tastier in smaller bites and when it&#8217;s layered in such a way to maximize flavor. Oh yeah, the video below is another neat animated presentation I found. This time on agriculture and the future from the University of Minnesota. What I particularly liked were the straight up facts presented alongside graphic metaphors, open-ended questions, and proposed solutions that make adaptation and addressing future needs possible.
