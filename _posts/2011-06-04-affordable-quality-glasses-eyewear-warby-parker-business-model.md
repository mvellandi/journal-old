I like the &#8220;Buy One, Give One&#8221; business model embodied by [Tom&#8217;s Shoes](http://www.toms.com/). It&#8217;s very intuitive, and not some limited promotion like some cause marketing programs. So long as the price and value are aligned, it&#8217;s all good. Here&#8217;s another interview I liked from BBMG, this time with a local NYC company I find fascinating. While cognizant that 14min is a long investment, you can listen in the background too.

> *&#8220;Mitch sits down with Neil Blumenthal, co-founder of <a href="http://www.warbyparker.com/">Warby Parker</a>, to discuss how the disruptive eyewear company delivers on style and substance. By designing their own frames and selling direct to consumers, Warby Parker saves customers hundreds of dollars per frame. By adopting a &#8220;buy a pair, give a pair&#8221; model, they embed a sense of purpose into their business design.&#8221;*
