A couple months ago, I attended [a neat panel discussion](http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/tribeca_talks_industry_-_are_documentary_films_changing_the_world-film36880.html) on how documentary films could reach larger audiences and hopefully have a positive impact or influence, based on the filmmaker&#8217;s intent. Here&#8217;s the official description:

> *&#8220;Documentary films unveil important truths, challenge assumptions, and often compel audiences to take action. Many of today&#8217;s filmmakers are faced with an additional challengeâ€”how do they ensure their film will have a significant impact on the public and on the policies their story highlights? The collaboration of filmmakers with NGOs and community groups has created a new distribution model, and the measure of success now reaches beyond sales to changes in public perception and policy. Join filmmaker and activist __Abigail Disney__, Give Up Tomorrow director __Michael Collins__, Executive Director and Co-Founder of Impact Partners__ Dan Cogan__, producer __Cynthia Lowen__ of The Bully Project, __Josh Baran __of Baran Communications, and others for an insightful discussion on the new paths of distribution for nonfiction films and the ways filmmakers and their subjects are making their voices heard. Moderated by independent producer and Outreach Director of The Good Pitch, __Sandi DuBowski__.&#8221;*

Josh spoke about &#8220;[Race to Nowhere](http://www.racetonowhere.com/)&#8220;, about education and kids stress. Distributed through schools and grassroots orgs, viewers paid $10, $5 of which went to the production company, and $5 to the school. Additionally, each school paid a nominal screening fee. Following the film, there was a discussion and action plan. Big organic publicity came after initial screenings.

&#8220;[Gasland](http://gaslandthemovie.com/)&#8221; was shown at Sundance Film Festival 2010, HBO picked it up, and it got 3.5 million viewers through their network. Compared to the 30k who saw it in theaters, that&#8217;s phenomenal. It was also shown through community and university screenings. CBS 60 minutes then did their own investigative story, followed by other news orgs around the country. Josh claims the flaming water faucet scenes were &#8220;gold&#8221;, and became the hook to draw people into the issue of fracking and water contamination.

Abigail spoke of how documentary filmmakers shouldn&#8217;t have to &#8220;beg for crumbs&#8221; and live poorly to make and distribute their production. There should be the option to somehow monetize it.

A big theme seemed to be how community screenings afforded people to stick around after the film and discuss it with others, compared to the big screen experience in which people leave their seats, and may talk about it within their little group on the way to the car.

Dan mentioned how &#8220;[No Impact Man](http://noimpactproject.org/movie/)&#8221; had influenced 50k colleges to host voluntary &#8220;no-impact&#8221; weeks for students.

Abigail then talked about [Lioness](http://www.lionessthefilm.com/) and the story of women combat fighting in Iraq. Though illegal, it was happening anyway. It started with women who could pat down Iraqi females, since male soldiers were severely chastised for doing so. These women never got combat pay and no healthcare treatment for PTSD or other ailments since they weren&#8217;t legally allowed to be fighting anyway. What ended up happening with enough exposure, is that it affected U.S. policy in the Senate, started discussions at Westpoint and the Defense Dept., and resulted in a commission&#8217;s [recommendation to end the combat exclusion policy](http://lionessthefilm.com/2011/03/pentagon-commission-recommends.html).

Cynthia spoke about &#8220;[The Bully Project](http://thebullyproject.com/)&#8220;, which premiered this Spring at Tribeca. They too are working on community screenings, 1st planned in Sept. in Philadelphia, with funding through foundations and nonprofits.

Personally, I really like the community screenings, but feel the option for distributing the film could be much wider through websites like Hulu, YouTube, and Netflix in addition to the cable networks. Depending on the situation (money/partners), I&#8217;d recommend creating a tiny program that downloads the movie and any additional media, through BitTorrent.
