Neat cause marketing video for the [Surfrider Foundation in Brazil](http://www.surfrider.org.br/), by an agency called Script. Here&#8217;s the official description:

> *Script has created an action for Surfrider Foundation Brasil, called &#8220;Return&#8221;. The action has as purpose to raise awareness and alert people about the consequences of the garbage left on Rio&#8217;s beaches.*
>
> *From a mailing list of surf shops and accredited NGOs, 10,000 boxes containing objects thrown on the sand were sent to people&#8217;s houses.*
>
> *Besides plastic cups, ice-cream packages, cans and water bottles, each box also contained a label with the following message:*
>
> *&#8220;The garbage thrown on the sea returns someday. For everybody.&#8221; &#8212; leaving it clear that, even who never threw garbage on the beach, one day, may suffer the consequences of such act.*
>
> *The action was also performed in bars in the city of Rio de Janeiro.*
