Apart from a great business model with a healthy product offering, I really dig [Naked Pizza&#8217;s](http://www.nakedpizza.biz/) extensive use of [video](http://www.vimeo.com/nakedpizza) for brand communications that combines journalism, storytelling, and inside views to their operations. Founder Jeff Leach writes on their [LivNaked blog](http://www.livnaked.com/) and in these two video clips, tells us why their dough balls are special, and some historical insights on the diversity of vegetables our ancestors ate.
