Another great brand communications video here, this time from [New Balance running shoes](http://www.newbalance.com/). Here they&#8217;re talking about the customization options for their [US574 shoe](www.shopnewbalance.com/newbalanceUS574M1.htm) along with tidbits about their operations and history in the Northeast U.S.

I like combining brand identity along with product marketing. It gives the message a bit of depth for those audiences who see the video for information about the shoe itself, but won&#8217;t come across a dedicated story about brand. You can see a variety of other videos from the [New Balance YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/loverunningmore) (including tennis lessons!).
