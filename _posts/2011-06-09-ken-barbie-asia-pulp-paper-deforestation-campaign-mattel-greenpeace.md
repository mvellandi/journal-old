Funny new Greenpeace campaign against Mattel for using [Asia Pulp & Paper](http://www.asiapulppaper.com/) as a 2nd/3rd tier supplier for its Barbie packaging. Combining the video shown below along with the URL [http://greenpeace.org/ken](http://www.facebook.com/greenpeace.international?sk=app_105552609534948) which links to a special Facebook page app, the campaign is pretty neat for its humor (video viewership at 120,000 after 4 days online) among other unique features like changing your Facebook photo to an angry Ken, and sending an email to Mattel&#8217;s CEO Bob Eckert.

Here&#8217;s the [LA Times coverage](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/06/mattel-rainforest-greenpeace-social-media.html) including reactions from Mattel, and [Business Wire&#8217;s press release](http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Newsfeed/Article/132361127/201106072300/Asia-Pulp-and-Paper-Challenges-Greenpeace-Attack-on-Indonesia-and-the-Toy-Industry.aspx) response from APP.
