[Race to Nowhere](http://www.racetonowhere.com/) is one documentary I recently referenced in a [blog post on distribution and influencing change](../documentary-films-expanding-distribution-influencing-change/). While the topic isn&#8217;t marketing nor innovation oriented, it is an interesting one indeed. Makes me wonder about the Chinese or Japanese cultures too though, since they&#8217;ve traditionally been stereotyped as placing a high value on education.
