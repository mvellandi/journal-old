Fantastic business model that&#8217;s a viable alternative to the Banana Republics and other middle to high-end clothing brands and their associated 3rd party textile manufacturing partners abroad. The part that resonates with me is the values branding at hand here, without all the traditional subjective marketing talk. As the video demonstrates, a complex story can be made concrete and likeable. Here&#8217;s the official description:

> _&#8220;The IOU Project produces unique, handmade apparel based on fabrics handwoven in India. Because each textile is unique, we provide end buyers with the ability to trace the production process from finished goods right back to the weaver that hand-wove the fabric. The stories of how that item was created, of the people involved, of the customers who purchased them, are the essence of the the e-commerce social network which The IOU Project has built as a meeting place for a community that shares our brand values of authenticity, transparency, uniqueness and both social and environmental responsibility.
