Neat series of interviews by my friend <a href="http://christinearena.com/">Christine Arena</a>, for Saatchi S on game interactions and positive outcomes. Having recently attended the <a href="http://gamesforchange.org/festival2011/">Games for Change conference</a> and enjoyed playing a few, there&#8217;s nothing like experiencing a demo.
