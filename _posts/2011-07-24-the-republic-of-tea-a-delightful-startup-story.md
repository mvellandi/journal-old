<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7224" title="republic of tea book" src="/images/2011/republic-of-tea-book.jpg" alt="republic of tea book" width="325" height="325" />As the first book I&#8217;ve read on entrepreneurship, [The Republic of Tea](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385420579/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=melodinmarke-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0385420579) tells the true story of the birth of a business, from an idea to launch. Chronicled through exchanged faxes, personal notes, illustrations, and business plans, it was exciting to read how co-founders Bill Rosenzweig and Mel & Patricia Ziegler (founders of The Banana Republic retail clothing stores), developed the company over two years.

The concept and business plan needed to mature at its own pace without any force or rushing. In the beginning, this entailed a concrete brand purpose, market research, and product development, then progressing into operations, distribution, funding, and financial analysis.

What I found most interesting was how much research (market & operations) was involved from beginning to end, a journey that led Bill from being an excited newcomer, to nearly an industry expert at 4 months before the company launched.

Although you or I may never be involved in launching a product company, it will give you appreciation for the process and what it takes to get there: patience, perseverance, curiosity, a critical mind, and a team of smart partners and advisers.
