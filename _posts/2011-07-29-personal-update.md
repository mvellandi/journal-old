It&#8217;s midsummer now, and I&#8217;m happy to have a job as the digital marketing manager for a nonprofit called the [Municipal Art Society](http://mas.org/), which advocates smart/sustainable urban planning, and the preservation & promotion of physical art (buildings, murals, statues, bridges) in New York City. The work is all encompassing including web content management (WordPress), email marketing and eCRM (Convio), analytics, Google AdWords, and social media. Feels good as the pay is great with lots of opportunity for skills improvement, and the people are very nice.

However, I learned a couple days ago that my mother has lung cancer. Stage 4, non-small cell, right lung, spread just to the chest wall. Not isolated, so chemotherapy is the only option. I had wondered if they could just remove the right organ and all might be okay, since that&#8217;s the word about kidneys. But I guess that&#8217;s not possible according to the doctors.

It&#8217;s hard to believe or comprehend the gravity of it all, except to know that someone you love and care for is just not going to be around much longer. __Update__: So it&#8217;s mesothelioma (as a result of asbestos exposure at some point in her life), with anywhere between 3mo. to 1yr remaining life expectancy.

Although the lady I&#8217;d been seeing for the last few months &#8212; a smart, green-minded, alpha-female architect &#8212; and I decided recently to take a break, I just don&#8217;t feel like becoming interested (casual or serious) in anyone for awhile. Socializing and being active in various interests are still important though, especially as a way to feel progress and momentum toward something meaningful. Suppose I&#8217;m just more selective of how I decide to spend time now, given the new job and time constraints.

Will still be posting interesting things from the last couple months I&#8217;ve taken notes on, or podcasts with people interviewed. Stay tuned, and have a safe & joyful summer.
