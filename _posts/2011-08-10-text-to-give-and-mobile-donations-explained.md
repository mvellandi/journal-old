A seamless approach to accepting mobile donations by billing usersâ€™ cell phone accounts is available through different providers. To donate, individuals type a specified keyword to a designated number. **ALL** providers charge a $500 setup fee that goes to the [Mobile Giving Foundation](http://www.hmgf.org/), which covers processing and security. Application, account setup, and live keyword process takes about 3-4 weeks. Remittances to organizations&#8217; bank accounts are made within 60-90 days from the Mobile Giving Foundation.

With some research, I&#8217;ve found two organizations with transparent plans and pricing:

[**Give by Cell**](http://www.givebycell.com/?page_id=44)

$974 = $500 (setup) + $474 ($79/mo. for 6 mo. term)

$0.48 per donation (flat fee)

[**mGive**](http://www.mgive.com/Pricing.aspx)

$2888 = $500 (setup) + $2388 ($199/mo. for 12 mo. term)

$0.35 per donation + 3.5 % card processing fee

An alternative approach is to send people text messages with links to mobile webforms, which users fill out with their payment information. One such provider is [Obopay](http://www2.obopay.com/merchant/text_to_pay_how.php). While such a process isn&#8217;t as seamless, and considering not everyone has smartphones, it does make mobile commerce easy for whatever the purpose.
