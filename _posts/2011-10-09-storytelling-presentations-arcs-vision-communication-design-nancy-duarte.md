Presenting ideas and convincing folks to buy into them is no easy task. Although facts, figures, propositions, reasoning, and calls-to-action are logical presentation elements, their mere inclusion doesn&#8217;t guarantee success.

I&#8217;ve shown videos and ideas of Nancy&#8217;s here before, but this recorded webinar should provide a lot more than the usual bout of pithy, quick-ideas and inspiration candy that I&#8217;m coming to avoid (separate topic).

Nancy describes here how one can weave stories into presentations. One powerful technique is a chronological swaying between _&#8220;What is&#8221;_ and _&#8220;What could be&#8221;,_ as opposed to a single time block devoted to each question_._

By doing so, we&#8217;re encouraging the audience members to think like designers. Contrasting the two states at a comfortable pace allows people to easier see parallels and differences; comparative strengths and weaknesses. I&#8217;m also keen to believe that such an approach can encourage co-ownership of proposed ideas and thus be far more attractive. That is, if the creator&#8217;s vision balances suggestion with normative statements.

I think you&#8217;ll particularly enjoy Nancy&#8217;s dissection of Lincoln&#8217;s _Gettysburg Address._
