Some months ago, I went to see the documentary film &#8220;[This Space Available](http://thisspaceavailablefilm.com/)&#8220;, about the grassroots movement around the world fighting for the protection of public spaces from advertisers. I&#8217;m quite happy that people and city governments are addressing it. Without laws protecting citizens&#8217; quality of life and enforcing them, advertising and promotion seeps into all corners of life. Balance must be ensured. It&#8217;s not just Sao Paolo that banned outdoor billboards. Since the early 80s, Houston, Texas has too.

In another clip below, the protestors had created a notice of condemnation under the guise of a supposedly official city organization. Funny part is, they altered my organization&#8217;s logo and letterhead to make it seem official ðŸ™‚
