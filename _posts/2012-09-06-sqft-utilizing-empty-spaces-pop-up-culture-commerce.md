On Wednesday, August 1st, <a href="http://www.yoursqft.com/">__SQFT__</a> (&#8220;square foot&#8221;) demonstrated the power of pop-ups in Mid-Market, San Francisco. Various locations along Market Street from 5th to 7th Street opened up their doors to new ideas and curious people.

I love the idea of matching temporary available space for temporary use. Now that&#8217;s maximizing space asset utilization rates (for good!). Look forward to seeing more from this organization.
