November 21st was my last day at the [Municipal Art Society](http://mas.org). It was a great 17 months. My workload had slowed down to minor ongoing improvement tasks and content management. So I provided a lot of documentation, trained staff, and provided a strategic roadmap.

After this job, I realized that nonprofits were in the business of selling outcomes.

The various ways we raised money below made me consider experience design opportunities within each.

  * Memberships / subscriptions
  * Sponsorships
  * Grants
  * Premium gifts
  * Public fundraising: ongoing and campaigns
  * Parties, concerts, presentations, and other charity events

Not just from a piecemeal perspective, but over time. For me at MAS, this entailed:

  * CRM email, ecommerce, donations, memberships, and events
  * CMS (web content) and DAM (digital asset managment) in various channels
  * Social Media

But honestly, one person alone cannot do this job effectively. Those involved in fundraising, programs, initiatives, and communications should be able to do all 3 above with very little support from any available technical staff or 3rd parties.

We can create the conditions so it&#8217;s possible. One needs managers and consultants who can:

  * Analyze content, interaction, and relationship architectures.
  * Find and prioritize strengths and weaknesses in the near term; opportunities and threats in the long term.
  * Lead and propose action, such as further inquiry or distinct solutions.
  * Clearly communicate the current situation, proposed action, and progress to date.

And also understand that:

  * The fewer software tools and providers to accomplish goals, the better. Do more with less.
  * People learn software and procedures best in little chunks that are applicable to a specific task they are going to do now or soon, with provided documentation written for humans.
  * Templates and visual editors make it easy for content administrators to get jobs done. Because nobody wants to learn HTML and CSS for little tweaks to make this or that prettier.
  * A good information architecture makes everyone&#8217;s lives easier, including search engines. Now and in the future. This pertains to websites, shared asset directories, and 3rd party hosts.

It&#8217;s nice to know at this time my personal strengths and areas for improvement.

What&#8217;s next? Volunteering and exploring. An acquaintance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art said they just ordered a 3D printer and would need someone to experiment, document, and talk about it.
