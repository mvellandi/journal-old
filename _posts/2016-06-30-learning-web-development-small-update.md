I hadn’t done any coding since January (4 month vacation break), so over the last few weeks I’ve slowly getting back into the swing. There was (and continues to be) a lot of reading Hacker News though, which is a fun distraction, time suck, and window to:

### Macro Dev Trends

like containerization, the increasing popularity of the Go and Rust languages, but also things I’d only recently heard of like ‘serverless’ and function-as-a-service (Way over my head).

As a systems-thinker and learner, this is all neat and good, but very slow absorbing. The whole dev world seems bent on: quality, speed, outsourcing — through: abstraction, modularization, cloudy stuff incl. microservices, and systems-level environment stuff.
While I’ll never be an engineer working with any of the infrastructure-oriented things above on a regular basis, it’s neat to keep an eye on because (it seems) building applications using other people’s platforms and libraries is getting easier and cheaper every day, although logistical coordination and dependency management becomes more complex and critical at the same time.

Trade-offs for simplicity. Good to know, will keep in mind. Applicable now? Kind of. Web applications don’t have to live on traditional servers managed by neo-telecom managed hosting providers. Push a repo to a container with common-configurations, for free, then pay when you’d like to go ‘live’ with your own domain or use more resources. Something like that. I’ve done it once as part of a rails tutorial, and while not quite so straightforward as dropping a folder of files into a public_html folder on a managed hosting account via FTP, it’s not scary.

### Progress Report

Since April 2015 I’ve learned language fundamentals (CSS, JS, Ruby), toyed with libraries (Sass, jQuery), and scratched the surface of Node and Rails. Only recently realized that video tutorials are SO much better than books are.
After visiting a Javascript coding boot camp in NYC, it seemed continued self-learning through projects was the way to go.
$17,000 for 6 weeks of classes, and five 5 weeks of projects, they had a couple big shortfalls in not teaching/using:
stable Angular 2.0 (instead they taught 1.x which has major differences)

* Typescript (type-checking)
* React (virtual DOM)
* ES6 (latest JS version), Babel (backward compatible translation), and Webpack (JS module bundler)

### Next Steps
Continued video tutorials which primarily teach how to build many small things.
This month I converted my old Wordpress blog with over 300 posts to Markdown files, and started learning Jekyll, a static website generator. The new blog will live as a project on Github Pages (free hosting!). And all other projects worked on will go there too or Heroku. We’ll see.
For now, it’s cool to know Jekyll better for ALL the things that don’t need CRUD capabilities.
