Summer so far has been about solidifying foundational knowledge on ES5 Javascript language syntax, and taking the next steps beyond simple jQuery usage. Among different books reading off and on I:

* Finished ["Javascript Patterns"](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752/)

* Did a Frontend Masters course on [JS Good Parts with Douglas Crockford](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-the-good-parts/)

* Started ["Seven Languages in Seven Weeks"](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/B00AYQNR46/) beginning with Ruby, then io, and currently working on Prolog, which is a fascinating way to declare the relationships between data, in addition to facts and rules governing how we can successfully query over the relations. Very practical for specific circumstances like scheduling but also used in ai.

* And am now 75% through a ["Udacity Course"](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) on making applications first using vanilla JS and jQuery, then teaching MVC, and now learning KnockoutJS.

I'm impatient and want to start learning Angular 2 or React asap. But I recognize that a solid foundation is more important if I want to be creative and excel far beyond a script kiddy reliant on frameworks and stack overflow.
