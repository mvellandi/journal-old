I've been working in digital media since 2004. Creating, managing, and designing how people interact with it. And now I'm taking the next step in my career: prototyping concepts, learning to code beyond HTML/CSS, and exploring interactive storytelling.

Business models and UX excite me.

Quick backstory: Born to German and Italian parents near Los Angeles, I spent many summers with relatives in Munich, a junior year of high school in Sweden, studied international business and supply chain management in college (Germany and California). And as a hobby I made personal websites with educational and job resources, and German film and book reviews.
